"I recently visited Mejuri and had a great experience! The store has a wide selection of beautiful pieces. The sales associates were incredibly friendly and helpful, offering great advice and making sure I felt comfortable throughout my visit and with my purchases.What really stood out was the piercing studio experience with Dawn (their in house piecer). She was not only knowledgeable but also professional and patient. Dawn gave me personalized ear styling tips, helping me select the perfect placement and jewelry that would complement my other piercings. The piercing studio is very clean and Dawn took great care in ensuring everything was sterile throughout the entire process. She used all the necessary precautions and followed a strict protocol to maintain a clean and safe environment, which made me feel even more confident in her expertise.Overall, I highly recommend Mejuri for both their beautiful jewelry and exceptional piercing experience. Its clear that they take great care in providing a top-notch customer experience! Will be back!",Chestnut Hill,0.0,2025-02-07,5,"27 Boylston St, Chestnut Hill, MA",MA,"

"Beware, this mostly online retailer has an F rating from the Better Business Bureau. I purchased a pair of their earrings that I later wished I had returned as they were far to too heavy to be comfortable to wear. I tried to post an honest review on their site which strangely never appeared after multiple attempts, making me doubt the validity of their customer product reviews. If you purchase any of their products, I would first visit the store and view in person, rather than going by the reviews. I would also  be sure to save all of the packaging materials in case you are not completely satisfied with the product (which may be likely). Mejuri has not responded on why the website did not accept my review, but did tell me they pass along my product feedback.",Boston,0.0,2025-01-10,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,"

"I came in to buy some hoops and the person who helped me made me feel very unwelcome. She didnt greet me at all and whenever I asked a question, gave me very short answers which made me feel very rushed. She seemed annoyed the entire time I was there. At the end of the purchase, she walked away without saying anything and went behind the counter so I awkwardly waited where I was until my earrings were ready. Everyone else seemed lovely so either she was having a bad day or I wasnt welcome.

"Came in for an EXCHANGE for a gift worth $100, or for store credit. Went through 3 people in order to find someone who could help me do the exchange (everyone was too busy and told me to wait, which was fine). What was not fine was, finally, when they were helping me, the person REFUNDED to the original payment instead of store credit for an exchange. He even asked me refund to original? with his finger hovering the button, and before I could say NO he pressed it. And then, he told he couldnt undo the refund and told me to ask the original gifter (who is long gone to another country, btw - also do you know how awkward that is??). I obviously did not bother my friend about it again, but this customer service is???",Boston,0.0,2024-12-10,1,"126 Newbury St, Boston, MA",MA,"

"I just visited Mejuri and had the worst possible experience. I am a frequent shopper of Van Cleese Arpels and Cartier. I was wearing this when I walked into the shop looking at rings. The woman working there dismissed me as soon as I walked in and said out loud "" use hand sanitizer before and after!!!"". I had not even picked up a piece of jewelry. I asked her to make sure what she knew she was saying because I was so shocked. Then she said it again. I am a VIC at Louis Vuitton and literally was wearing 40k in Cartier. To be treated like trash is beyond me. This place deserves to go down in flames. I get fliers all the time at my high rise apartment asking to visit. This place is trashy just like their associates.

I love shopping at Mejuri online to get my wife necklaces and bracelets so we were excited to shop in store for the first time. Its a real shame that the whole duration no one helped us at all while the employee kept asking everyone else if they have been helped out yet.

At first the young woman who asked me what I was looking for seemed like she was not in the mood for working. Without even making an effort to check, she first said that the earrings I wanted were not available in-store. Right after I said Ok, I guess Ill just make my purchase online she magically remembered they were in stock in the back room! The whole 5 minutes I was there she acted as if she was doing me a favor.

"I really dont write reviews but I was extremely shocked and unimpressed by how I was treated at this location. Im going to make this VERY clear that I work within the retail sector and have been for 10+ years, WITH experience in jewelry, so I know what great CX is supposed to look like.Firstly, I was made to feel like I wasnt wanted in the store. I came in with high intent to purchase (and I did), but not a single associate greeted me, or asked me for help as I was visibly browsing. I had to flag an employee to discuss the earring selection.She was ""kind"", but was also speaking to me as if I couldnt afford a $500.00 pair of solid gold hoops? Very insulting, because it wasnt once, it was multiple times I was spoken to in a condescending manner about price range. THAT truly spoiled the experience, and because of that Ill either shop online or never again with the brand.If I came in with the intention to buy real gold hoops, that was going to be a sale you lost because of how I was spoken to. Do better, and treat every single customer with the same courtesy.The singular star is because I love my earrings and am happy with my purchase, but I think Ill continue to support the mom and pop shops that are the real purveyors of the NYC jewelry scene.",New York,0.0,2024-09-10,1,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,"

"I would not recommend Mejuri wedding bands.Goodbye Mejuri, it was nice while it lasted.Id bought rings at Mejuri before (Spring St location- they were lovely) and figured it would be a good place to get my wedding bands. I went to the Williamsburg location, where they didnt have the sizes we needed in stock, so we had them shipped to our home. The first red flag here is that we were told a signature would be required for delivery, but the rings were just left in our lobby. Glad I worked from home that day so I could pick them up quickly, but the package could have easily been stolen.After trying the ring on for a little longer, my partner realized that he needed a smaller size. My office is a block away from the Flatiron Mejuri location, so we stopped in around lunch on a weekday, in the hopes we could do a quick exchange. Everyone on the floor was busy when we walked in, so we posted up by the wedding bands to wait for somebody to be free.We waited for at least 10 minutes without as much as a hello. I made eye contact with a salesperson and she, seeming surprised, asked oh, do you need assistance?. Oof, second red flag. Maam, maybe I do look poor, but I thought we were living in a post-Pretty-Woman society, where I was allowed to shop while frumpy.I asked if we could exchange my partners ring for a smaller size, and possibly mine for a thinner one. The vibe was icy and skeptical. The rings were taken back and reviewed-- mine had multiple scratches and could not be exchanged. Fair, whatever. My partners had one small scratch and could not be exchanged. What? They admitted that it might have just been sold to us that way, but we would have to return to the Williamsburg location and try our luck there.Maybe its just because Im in my thirties now, but I truly want to get serious about my jewelry, which means having a relationship with a jeweler I feel comfortable with and who can back up their pieces or like... resize them at least. Mejuri is not that. Come here for a cute trendy piece (and dress the part if you dont want to be ignored). Dont come here for anything important.",New York,0.0,2024-10-10,1,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,"

"Horrible Experience at this location. When I asked to check if the earring placements are ok, he was extremely curt and didnt want to show me which areas I can place the earring on.I have previously gotten pierced at Maria Tash and the experience was much better.Here the piercer didnt show me if the needles are sterilized, if the jewelry is sterilized and he was clearly annoyed when I asked to move the placement.This type of service for piercing is unacceptable. If the appointments are 20 mins only, they should tell people to show up early to select jewelry. Piercing is a permanent modification. Rushing someone through it is extremely unprofessional and makes the customer feel really unhappy. I literally walked away feeling that I was shooed away.Also to add, I got my cartilage piercing first and got my lobe done after, and idk what happened but he applied so much force on the lobe one it was hurting a lot. This is my 5th piercing and Ive never had anyone push the needle in with so much force on the lobe piercing.Honestly I was extremely unhappy with how the appointment went.So not recommended at all, please book somewhere else.",New York,0.0,2024-11-10,1,"144 5th Ave, New York, NY",NY,"

"I received no assistance from the staff upon entering the store. It was challenging to determine who was an employee, so I had to take some time to observe the situation before seeking help. I was drawn to the Zodiac necklace and inquired about trying on my zodiac sign, but the salesperson directed me to the display, claiming they were identical, which was not the case. Despite the discrepancy, I was still fond of the style and expressed my intention to purchase it. Retrieving the item from the storage area took an unexpectedly long time. Upon returning home, I discovered that I had been given the incorrect necklace. The email receipt showed the correct item, but the one in my possession was different.

I got a necklace gifted to me for my birthday and within 3 days it broke. I brought it in with the order receipt and was allowed to trade it in for a new one because of the warranty. However they didnt have the necklace and had to ship it to me (I am visiting NYC and live in California) and I had to ship it to California because I dont live here. They still had to charge me and I had to pay for THEIR broken necklace that was MY birthday gift. Very disappointed in this customer service. You would think that given their quality of product that they would cover such a thing because the damage is their fault. They couldnt even try to find if a different location here might have it in stock??????Will probably not shop again because of this service and will definitely warn my friends based on this.,New York,0.0,2024-11-10,2,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"Security guard was being really extra and overbearing when we were just trying on some bracelets for size because my friends wrist is really small. The store associate told him to back down, but it was weird. It didnt help that we werent really getting helped by the associates and nobody was coming up to ask us if we would like to know the prices of things or recommendations. Came in there ready to buy but they didnt make it any easier or comfortable. My friend bought a $300 necklace but they were treating us as if we came there to steal. She really came in there ready to buy so she bought something anyway, but I strongly considered telling her to walk out.",New York,1.0,2025-01-27,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I booked a piercing appointment a week ago and when I arrived into the store today I was told to check my email. What I found was that an hour earlier, my appointment had been canceled due a change in the piercers schedule. As someone who is not constantly checking their email (as most people), I find this entirely unacceptable. I should have received as a minimum a text, which I would have seen. A total waste of time and a very nonchalant sales associate who was in no way helpful.

"Avoid. If you dont avoid... only buy in the store, and only buy something you know you will absolutely not need to return.They sent me earrings that apparently had tiny scratches on them that were not visible to the naked eye. I took them out of their bag only to try them on, realize I didnt like them (they were so heavy that they were stretching out my ear holes and it was uncomfortable) and I put them right back in the bag.  When I tried to return them, THIS is apparently when the earrings were thoroughly inspected with a microscope. (Not before I purchased them.) They did not accept the return because of scratches, which I know with 100% certainty I did not cause. I also could not see any scratches on the earrings when the associate in the store was trying to show me. So make of that what you will.I was offered store credit instead of a refund, which is better than nothing, but I still feel taken advantage of. And Im not super excited to use my store credit, because based on this (if the scratches were even real) and based on other reviews, it seems like there is a quality problem with the jewelry from Mejuri which the company shows no interest in taking responsibility for once a purchase has taken place. Its really a shame, because the designs are beautiful.Edit for fairness:I was provided with a refund to my payment method after the company noticed my review.",New York,0.0,2024-08-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I had a terrible experience with customer service at this store. I received a pair of earrings as a birthday gift this weekend. I wanted to exchange them for a different pair of earrings.

"This is the first review Ive ever left online, but I was truly disappointed with my experience today. Went by the Soho location this evening, to pick up an order that Id purchased online during the Black Friday sale. I specifically chose to pick up in store so that I could discuss styling options with the staff - I really hoped for some suggestions on curating a pretty ""earring stack"", something Mejuri advertises all over its website and social media. I spent $1200 on 14k gold pieces, (which is a big investment for me) and even intended to grab a few more items during my visit. Most of the staff members were friendly, and the store itself was aesthetically quite pleasing, which is why Im leaving 2 stars instead of 1. That said, the piercer on duty was honestly really, really rude. Each time I asked him for his insight, he would very flatly respond with something along the lines of ""its all personal preference"", and his tone, body language, and facial expressions all came across as condescending and judgmental, like he thought I was a waste of his time, as well as an idiot for not knowing exactly what I wanted and where. I honestly felt really embarrassed and uncomfortable. Instead of leaving with more pieces, I returned everything that I purchased. This whole experience really turned me off from Mejuri, and Ill be taking my money elsewhere, unfortunately.",New York,0.0,2024-12-10,2,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I bought a ring recently from Mejuri, but when it was delivered, I realized I had ordered the wrong size. I only tried the ring on once and immediately put it back in the box to return it.However, after they received the return, I was only issued store credit instead of a full refund.When I contacted customer service, they claimed the ring had scratches, which is completely false. I know for certain that I did not scratch the ring, as I barely handled it. It feels like Mejuri is unfairly trying to avoid honoring their return policy by shifting the blame onto customers, which is extremely disappointing.Ill never order from them again.I recommend thinking twice before purchasing from Mejuri if you expect fair treatment with returns.",New York,0.0,2024-11-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I lost my diamond tennis bracelet in June (clasp opened and slipped off my wrist). Devastated, I called the store, assuming that nothing could be done (not Mejuris fault!) however much to my surprise and delight the manager agreed to replace it free of charge, sending me a brand new one. As it was back-ordered, they told me it would arrive in August. It arrived yesterday (July) and I was elated! Only minor problem now was the reverse, whereas the clasp before was too loose (bracelet fell off) this new one had a super secure one, so secure that I couldnt take it off! I went to the store and it had a different open/close mechanism, but the store clerk recognized how difficult it was and offered to get me a THIRD bracelet, so that it would be perfect. Incredible above and beyond service, and I am over the moon that Mejuri replaced the first bracelet, and now again the second, as the clasp wasnt totally perfect. Truly wow-worthy service and Ive been shouting my story from the rooftops as Im so impressed with the brand! THANK YOU Mejuri!",New York,1.0,2024-08-10,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"This Mejuri location does not accept cash, which is not only an illegal and finable offense in New York City, but also a practice that discriminates against the socioeconomically disadvantaged, particularly communities of color. Even people without a credit or debit card should be able to treat their sweetie to a $38 pair of earrings if they so choose, so I was very disappointed when the clerk told me they would not take my cash. I am considering filing a formal complaint with the city, and urge any other customers who care about their poor brothers and sisters to do the same by searching NYC Cash Payment Refusal in their browser.",New York,0.0,2024-09-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"DO NOT GET PIERCED HERE.I usually go to tattoo/piercing parlors but got a tragus piercing here because my sister wanted to get something done together. I completely regret coming here because now I have an infected tragus piercing.One, I dont think mejuri focuses on the actual healing process of a piercing (focuses on aesthetic instead) and doesnt do well with informing the client what can/cant be done. Ive gotten several cartilage piercings before and the piercer inserted a bar thats WAY too short for my tragus (left no room for swelling/healing). Because of this, my piercing has consistently been infected and has a keloid despite how much I clean it and avoid laying on it.Not only that, but I found the piercers provided basically no after care besides some QR pamphlet...which I found embarrassing. I cant imagine if youre someone who has no experience with piercings and your piercer doesnt even educate you on after-care. Luckily I have experience with piercings so I know the protocol; but every other piercer Ive been at has always done a through aftercare with the client letting them know what to do. Also, usually they have saline solution you can purchase to clean the piercing (mejuri does not offer that...and I consider that pretty standard for a piercer to have on hand for clients).Maybe if youre only buying jewelry, come here.Otherwise youll just leave with an infected ear and to be out $200-$300. Go to a proper parlor and itll only cost $20-$60 for a piercing.",New York,2.0,2024-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

Negative Issue: The reviewer regretted getting a tragus piercing at Mejuri and had a negative experience due to the piercing being infected and not healing properly. They also felt that the focus was on aesthetics rather than proper healing and that the piercer did not provide adequate aftercare instructions.

Staff Behavior: The reviewer felt that the staff did not properly inform them about the healing process and did not provide thorough aftercare instructions. They also did not have saline solution available for purchase, which is considered standard in the piercing industry.

Suggestions for Improvement: The reviewer suggests going to a proper piercing parlor for better results and mentions that Mejuri should focus more on the healing process and provide better aftercare instructions. They also suggest having saline solution available for purchase."

I mentioned to person that the holes didnt look even and he didnt really comment on that.

"October 2023 - I used to love this company and now they are selling products that are no longer 14k gold (cost over $500). I bought my husband a wedding band that was 14k white gold and in less than 4 months the color changed white gold to an odd yellow color. He is exchanging the ring but I am worried the same thing is going to happen.Additionally, I bought him a 14k gold bracelet here (also costing over $500) and the color is no longer gold. It is a pink color. This we cant even exchange because it is past the 2 year warranty.I will no longer be buying from this company and used to love it. The quality is pretty awful now. We also really bad customer service experience in the soho Mejuri store when we went in to show the ring and bracelet. The sales rep was extremely rude to my husband.Update as Nov 2023 -Mejuri replaced my husbands wedding ring in October. The ring yet again changed from white gold to a yellow color in 4 weeks.

"Not a single thing in the whole store is labeled so you have to ask someone to know the price, the materiel i.e. if its solid gold or vermeil, the name of the piece if youre trying to match it to their online inventory, etc. its fine if you are a pretty young white girl but if you dont fit the stereotype, no one will help you and it will take forever to buy something. I was not offered help a single time even though there were plenty of employees. I finally nailed down someone who was super sweet to another customer for buying something.

"I booked an appointment to have my ears pierced. I initially planned to get three piercings. However, after consulting with Mike (the piercer if thats an actual titled?) he informed me that the style I wanted required an earring size that is not sold by the company. He then immediately recommended a tattoo parlor close by that could do the style for me. I really appreciated his honesty. He could have tried to sell me an earring style that would have been ""close enough"" in size but he was honest in saying none of them were the proper size for what I wanted and  I appreciated that. He took time with me for a mini consultation and was very patient as I had to reorganize my thoughts and decide on what I wanted given I was unable to achieve the style I originally booked the appointment for. He was very kind and very professional. He made my experience so enjoyable and I will definitely return for future piercings. In addition, I purchased a bracelet which I scouted out on the website prior to coming in-store. The sales associates were nice and attentive. My shopping experience was great. I was a bit hesitate given the recent comments regarding the sales associates on google review but I am happy to say my experience was 10/10.",New York,2.0,2024-02-10,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I used to shop at the Mejuri SOHO store pre-pandemic, and the service used to be fabulous!Ever since the pandemic, the level of service seems to go down a bit more every time I returned. I visited the SOHO store today 8/24/2023 at around 2:30pm. At the time, there were less than a total of 10 people in the store. I was browsing the 14k solid gold counter, where a sales associate was positioned, she was at the time not servicing other customers.For the 2-3 min while I walked around the counter, clearly interested in making a purchase, not only did she not budge from her spot at the counter, she had ZERO intentions to even drop a simple ""hello"" or ""welcome"".When I used to come to the store, the sales associate would help to sanitize the pieces that I wanted to try, so when I asked where I can find the sanitizing swabs, she made a snarky comment and said ""theyre all cleaned."" I wasnt about to take her word for it, so then I asked politely where I could get some swabs to do it myself. She pointed ""somewhere"" to the middle of the counter and said, its all in there. It took me a good 5 seconds to see and realize that she was pointing to a covered marble cup holder in the middle of the counter, but she couldnt be bothered to even help me grab it or to even clearly indicate what she was referring to.I also asked her about the product that I was looking for. After telling me that they didnt have it in stock, I asked her for something comparable, where she then answered ""Im not sure whats the most similar piece."" I tried the product and despite liking it, I wanted to leave and order online so that I didnt have to deal with the unacceptable level of customer service that I received.The irony of this whole experience was that, as I was leaving the store, the security guard at the front of the door said to me ""have a nice day!"" I honestly think the security guard wouldve been a more fit salesperson and the associates actually working there.As a fellow Canadian, I love supporting domestic brands. But between competitor brands like Kinn Studio, Aurate, Catbird and others, the level of service is just inexcusable.Will also be sending a review to your media accounts.",New York,7.0,2024-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"Mejuri markets itself as high quality for lower prices.Cons:(1) Images online are NOT always reflective of the piece in-person -- for example, a necklace I ordered had a lobster clasp in its online product photo, but when I received it it was a spring ring (lobster clasps are better and easier to use)(2) they are a good value if you compare them to a luxury designer like Tiffany or Cartier obviously, but they are notably more expensive per gold weight than their actual peer competitors like Quince.(3) They are a retail store more than a jewelry store, as in they dont have jewelers in-store or repair any of their pieces. Which is fine, but their employees can only provide very basic jewelry guidance.(4) Customer service is mixed. I ordered an item on 11/28/22 which made it eligible for the 60-day holiday return policy (normally its 30 days), although it was backordered, and then further delayed so I only received it in the mail on 2/9/23. I went in-store to return it only 2 weeks later after receiving it, however the employee gave me a hard time insisting that it was beyond the 30 day window and that she would ask the manager for a one-time exception. However, its returnable for 60 days (normally 30 days) from the date of delivery (confirmed with customer service online). I tried to explain this but employee was reeaally insistent and was acting like she was doing me a huge favor by making a one-time exceptionPros:(1) Their social media customer service seems pretty decent. They quickly clarified their 60-day holiday return policy and that it begins from the date of receiving the item.(2) In-store you can just grab and try-on whatever items, so you can try on basically all their store items pretty quickly (vs. requiring an employee to let you try one item on at a time which takes forever). Lots of seating for the waiting boyfriends/shopping partners too.I have no experience regarding their warranty.

The chain is very thin and chintzy so I decided to quit trying to untangle it and just return it. The ring is a nice design but looked cheap on me.

"One of the worst and most frustrating customer experience I ever had!! I ordered a necklace during Black Friday, it came all tangled up and impossible to untangle. I reached out to customer service to get a replacement after returning the first one. Guess what? The second necklace also came all tangled. Ive been trying to return the second one for a month now. The labels Ive been sent were either already used or wrong (Ive been asked to drop them at FedEx while the label was a DHL one). In the meantime I am still waiting for a refund. This shows a carelessness and lack of consideration for my time and energy. Ive been emailing back and forth to get this sorted out and going to FedEx multiple times.

"Just avoid this cheap jewelry. My husband got me a necklace from here and it arrived used. It was rusted and scratched and the chain was tangled. When we contacted customer service they said we had to ship it back and then they would send the replacement. 3 weeks passed and no one contacted him to inform him the necklace was out of stock and to as it to his ""wish list"".

"I have been buying from Mejuri for a few years now and really like their jewelry.That said, I recently made my first couple visits to the store and have been disappointed with the experience around order pick-up. At my first visit, I waited over 20 minutes for my name to be called after checking in. At my second, I waited 15 minutes, and 2 different people who I watched check in after me had their names called first. I also saw someone decide to buy a new item, pay for it, and get it packaged up all in the span of time that I waited. In both cases I was just buying a single necklace, nothing complicated. My expectation around pickup is that, since I got an email saying my order was ""ready"", it should be all packaged up and ready to go and handing it off to me should just be a matter of grabbing the right bag and not take 15-20 minutes each time. At this point it seems like Id be better off just buying items in-store and not bothering with the advance order and pickup.The employees have all been super nice and Im sure they are doing their best but it seems like the pickup process is flawed and/or they are really understaffed.",New York,1.0,2023-02-10,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"This is a slightly delayed review re:a visit in mid May. Myself and one other Black woman have been to this location before and found the shopping experiences to be great. We came in this afternoon in mid may and for the entire experience employees (on different occasions) seemed to be hovering near/around us as we shopped. It seemed that the other shoppers were roaming with much more space and ease. Hopeful that Mejuri staff has undergone training so that this can be avoided in the future; it was very clear that, as Black women, employees interacted with us differently than the other non-black shoppers. Really disappointing.",New York,23.0,2023-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"TLDR:Poor service. Spend your money where you are treated with respect.Context:I visited the Mejuri store on Spring St. to purchase two items. When I entered I immediately asked for the pieces I wanted to purchase, a pair of sterling silver earrings and an ear cuff, to try on. As I tried on the items, I asked a question regarding the dullness of the pieces and if polishing them would help them appear shiner. The associate was unsure and provided a piss-poor response making no attempt to seek assistance from a more knowledgeable staff member or her manager. As I continued trying on the pieces, I overheard the the associate and her co-worker talking about me, not to mention the associate who was supposed to be helping me and instead was commenting on my weird question, did so in a mirror that I could see and easily read her lips in (genius, she is not!)After overhearing the conversation I put the items down and started to leave. However, as I was still upset, I returned to the store and complained to the manager. The manager was apologetic of course, but honestly, how am I expected to believe anything coming from her if your employee is so emboldened to talk about the customer theyre serving the middle of a transaction. To me, this speaks to the culture of the store and tells me that this is acceptable behavior. I have worked in several customer-facing roles, retail and otherwise, and would never had dreamed of talking about a customer in their face unless I thought this was acceptable practice. Without a shred of doubt, I can tell you I would never shop at this location again.If you do venture into this location, avoid the associate who helped me at all cost. I dont know her name, however, she is white, very pale, wears glasses, has about 8 inches of new growth with green, dry looking ends, and an affinity for white culottes.",New York,8.0,2023-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"Underwhelming experience. I came here to pickup my online order and I walked in. Not a single greeting and it wasnt even busy in the store. I saw two people working just busy chit chatting and I had to volunteer and come up and to one of them to check in with my order. I work in customer service as well and this has got to be one of the worst shopping experiences Ive had. Jewelry shopping is supposed to be fun. The lady who got my order was nice and we had a little talk about the jewelry I just purchased. I was interested in buying other stuff in-store, I was looking around and people who work there just look at you and its very intimidating. It feels like youre being snobbed.

"The jewelry designes are very attractive, but the earrings Ive tried both had broken lockers, so seems to be they are not long-lasting.

I am never the type to write a review but I cant over my last visit to this store. As someone who has been to the Toronto location various times it is disheartening to have experienced what I did. The employee with the green hair has by far the worse customer service I have ever experienced in my 49 years. She was very dismissive and seemed to be annoyed that I was asking her questions. I no longer wanted to purchase because of her attitude. If you visit stay clear of the green hair. I will not be returning.,New York,7.0,2023-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"After repeated difficulty making a return online (they didnt send an invoice first, then wrong shipping label, then wrong instructions), we decided to make a return in person at this location. When we arrived, there was a long line  (easily over an hour) and the door person initially said we wouldnt have to wait if we were just doing a return. After telling her we did not plan on browsing, she told us to wait on the shopping line for her to call us in for the return. After waiting for 40 minutes on the line, I asked another worker and she let us off the line and finally helped us.Absolutely horrible customer service experience (online and in store) and will not be shopping this brand again.

"I own many mejuri pieces. Never had a problem. Excellent service until recently. I placed a Christmas order December 1st. Was informed the next day, due to the holidays my order would be shipping December 16th. No problem.It is December 21st and I get an email TODAY stating there was a glitch in their system and my item is actually out of stock. They have refunded the order. Not only is this beyond frustrating to now have to search for a gift super last minute when I work until Christmas even 8pm… I attempt to purchase another item instead (costs twice as much but its fine because its worth it).I ask for assistance in getting the expedited shipping (cost $15 but its ok bc again its worth it) and they tell me I cannot. It was an option for me to click on but I wasnt able to go back to fix it after that order was processed.They basically try to shut me up and tell me theyll give me $20 credit to my account (my order cost $550.)

"I would never shop here again. If you ever have to return anything, good luck. Horrible ethics and customer service. I returned a pair of brand new earrings in store on 11/5  and its 11/19 a WHOLE 2 weeks later and the funds still havent hit my account. I contacted CS several times and yesterday one person finally said Ive initiated the return which makes no sense because now do I have to wait an extra supposed 5-10 business days which they claim is the routine time on top of the 2 weeks? NO other business takes this long to refund money. I shopped at major brands and the refund literally returns the same day if not the next day or 48 hours max.

"I came here two days ago with a friend who was exchanging an item. Service was great, the person who greeted us at the door was sweet and even at one point picked up a ring I clumsily dropped. The person attending to my friend was also very nice! My problem lies with who im assuming is security, he was very unfriendly and followed us throughout the shop from the moment we entered. He was so blatant that he graduated from giving me and my friend looks and hovering near where we would stand to actually go behind the counter and stand almost directly in front of us even though I am assuming he was not selling jewelry. We made direct eye contact and it was then when he finally decided to move but he was staring  at me the whole time. I still do not understand why he did that because even if it was a concern for theft I was directly in front of a sales associate my entire visit except for when my friend and I moved location in the store because we felt so uncomfortable with his behavior. This was the most blatant profiling I have experienced, and based on previous reviews  it seems like he does this often.My friend loves the jewelry here and always constantly raves about it, it was my first time in this store and although majority of the employees here were sweet my experience with the security was so off putting that I doubt I will ever come back.",New York,4.0,2023-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I have been obsessed with Mejuri since the brand first hit the scene, and even more since they opened their doors! Usually when I visit I am greeted with bubbly faces and kindness, however, this past weekend (Saturday), I had a completely different experience. The store was packed and busy and the associates were helping as many people as they could, yet the harshness and cold demeanor of the store manager (Dani - I asked for her name) was extremely off putting. I have visited the store a couple of times now and have come familiar with the associates there, but this time around the manager who I was dealing with couldnt give me more than 2 seconds of her time. Within 2 minutes of our time together, she left me and the questions I had hanging and assisted another woman who walked in after me.

"I used to love this brand, I still love their products--but the customer service and overall terrible experience at the Spring St. location has unfortunately left me unable to support this brand. They are so incredibly rude, often acting annoyed that I dare want to spend my money there. Today, I went in with my fiance to look for wedding bands, as we were shopping I asked to try on some rings--the woman behind the counter rolled her eyes and was like ok, sure. Right after I tried on a ring, another woman ran up to the lady who was in front us saying she should never leave the product out--like I am sitting here, trying on rings to buy and the staff act annoyed and only care to make moves if rings are left out in front of people who are actually trying to buy the rings. Ughs, just terrible. Ive never been made to feel like such a burden for wanting to spend so much of my money at an establishment. Terrible vibes, terrible customer service. Give your money to nicer people elsewhere--we ended up stopping by a place in Hoboken on our way home. She greeted us with joy, offered us beverages and was thrilled that we wanted to potentially spend our money with her. We did, we bought both rings and left feeling good and excited.

"I decided to try Mejuri after reading the stellar reviews. I was disappointed every step of the way. It appears to be a great business model, but is very poorly executed. I visited the store on Spring St in NY. Only half the staff seemed somewhat interested in helping.

"Do not even bother with their jewelry. I have completely given up on Mejuri. The quality of jewelry is subpar for the price. I love jewelry and decided to purchase three necklaces a few months ago. As of this post all three necklaces have turned brown. None of my other jewelry ever changed color except the ones from Mejuri. I am extremely careful with my jewelry. Always kept them out of the sun, never have them touch water or anything else and kept them safely stowed away in their pouches. I was so upset I didnt discover this was a issue with Mejuri  jewelry. I would of never purchased. Save your money and go elsewhere.",New York,12.0,2022-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"This one star review is specially for their VERMEIL collection. Disclaimer I love their styles and designs but their vermeil products needless to stay is not worth with the price point we are paying. I own several of the gold pieces and some occasion Ive gifted them to my friends and highly recommended it. But last year, I decided to purchase their vermeil collection as the design I.e. dome croissant come to my liking however after one year in and suddenly one day when I opened my jewelry box I found the pieces in discolored form completely turned blue-purpleish. I got so worried and looked up their company warranty policy and was glad to see that product was under it. But was sad to find out about when their customer service told me that it doesnt qualify under accidents scenario, when I honestly told them that it mightve came in contact with hand sanitizer as in todays situation which is so difficult to avoid. However, with my constant afford to restore my pieces they finally agreed to send me a LITERALLY a 2X2 inch polishing cloth. It did the job but I am so disappointed and even regretted purchasing their vermeil piece as I expected the quality could have been much higher with the price point we paying so it wont be easily discolored or tarnished 😔 As it almost loosing my faith in their pieces and sort of drifting me away in making future purchases from them.",New York,8.0,2022-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

Lovely jewelry but skip the SoHo store — there is a long line to get in and after you purchase something theyll ask you to wait outside (took ~10 minutes) while they get it from the back. On a super hot summer day (and also trash day no less) its not an ideal experience as a paying customer to stand outside next to a pile of steaming trash after you spent hundreds of dollars in the store. Surely they could have a waiting area inside. Ill order online next time.,New York,8.0,2022-02-10,3,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

The store is lovely and the jewelry is beautiful. Im not sure if only 1 staff is allowed to be at each counter but when I was there I was looking for earrings. The counter where they were at already had 2 other customers and another 2-3 came after me. The girl was very nice and trying to help everyone. However there was another staff right across on a counter that had no customers at all. Perhaps it would have been best to have her come over to help. I understand you dont want to leave an open counter with jewelry unattended but there should be a better system for helping customers. I look forward to going back for more jewelry and for their piercing events.,New York,2.0,2020-02-10,4,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"I found this store be extremely unprofessional. I understand having to limit the amount of people coming into the store due to Covid -19, but I waited for 30 minutes in line outside, and the sales team mentioned they close the doors ten minutes early in order to give the people shopping time to wrap up. I got called to come in at exactly 6:50 and the sales associate stopped me to say "" sorry were closed""  meanwhile, there was only 3 people left in the store with multiple sales associates standing around talking while there was a line of at least 15 people outside ready to purchase.  As someone that works in a retail environment, there is nothing worse then turning people away when there is available staff to help and money to be spent.  What is keeping customers from making all their purchases online? A helpful and engaging sales team, and a pleasant in store shopping experience. Hopefully this team can learn that and stop closing early so they can go home.",New York,7.0,2022-02-10,1,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

I have been trying to return a gift I received for 2 weeks-complete nightmare. Finally decided to stick it out in line because it was shorter than it had been.

"Bought several gold vermeil items from them last year. Stored them away in the pouches, just like instructed. Each piece was waiting for their day In the limelight due to covid/ nowhere to wear them last year . Took them out today and every single piece is tarnished!!!  Covered in black/ brown spots! None of these pieces were ever worn before and safely stowed away. Attempted to clean by buffing gently with dry cloth like instructions said to no avail. So disappointed because they are such nice items but now unwearable. Waste of money!!!!!

"Had an amazing one on one stylist experience at Mejuri ! I booked the one on one because I know how crazy the store can get, and I was hoping to sit down with someone to find my wedding band. I looked at the website before my appointment so I had some ideas in mind. When my fiancé and I arrived they had everything prepared, including the styles I liked and some refreshments. One of the styles I picked ended up being the winner. I loved being able to try it on in person and see how it looked with my engagement ring (which is a family heirloom btw!) My fiancé and I left thrilled that I found my winning wedding band, and to our surprise it arrived about a day and a half later at my house. Cant wait to purchase some other jewelry from Mejuri in the future. Who knows, maybe Ill find some wedding earrings too.

"FYI this is is just a showroom for now. So you wont be able to WALK AWAY with any jewelry. If you order to store, it will come in 1-2 business days. If you order to home, it will come another 1-2 days after that.For a dainty gold fiend like myself, I spent way too much time trying everything on three times. Its really nice that you can just walk up to a piece and put it on:earrings, rings, bracelets, anklets. Every employee has the price and material memorized for each piece and iPads are available for you to scroll through as well. SOME pieces are not in store to try on but the employees know them well so they can give their opinion.The whole showroom has a wedding registry vibe with nice sofas, a little nook to sit down and make your orders, etc. There is also a piercing studio if you want to get a purchased stud put in (unclear how that works since they dont sell items there).",New York,0.0,2020-02-10,5,"43 Spring St, New York, NY",NY,"

"Product line is great and staff are extremely helpful and courteous.   However, the place needs to get their payment system in order.  They must use a canadian payment processor so US CCs get declined all the time.  Reason being when you make a purchase it alerts your CC company as if someone possibly stole your card and is trying to use it in Canada.

"I bought the Diamond Necklace ($298) for my girlfriend to match a ring that she has.  She tried it on when I brought it home, and the chain broke while she went to remove it.  Literally immediately.  Clearly, there was a defect in the chain, because she didnt pull at it, didnt get stuck on clothing or hair, it just fell apart.  She immediately submitted a customer service claim (which purports to respond within 24 hours).  After 6 days, they finally responded and said that they will not be honoring the Warranty Policy because either:1. the claim is outside the two year period (false), 2. the item is lost and not in our possession (false), incorrect materialcare was provided to the piece (false, it was just taken out of the box), normal wear and tear such as scratching or bent (also false, again, it was just taken out of the box), or a third-party vendor was used to repair the item (again, it was just taken out of the box).  This company is a complete scam, they clearly did not read the claim and just automatically rejected it.  I will be disputing this purchase with my credit card.  What a joke of a company, and terrible quality jewelry.",Philadelphia,1.0,2024-12-10,1,"1525 Walnut St, Philadelphia, PA",PA,"

"I purchased an emerald baguette stud earrings less than 2 months ago.  Ive worn it twice. I love it a lot except the other day, it totally fell off my right ear. It almost went down the drain as I was washing my hands. The 14k gold backing for some reason did not fit eventhough Ive had it on all day. Weird! I went back to this location to make a complaint. I was greeted by the manager, Emma. She quickly replaced my backing and gave me an extra one with no questions asked. Excellent customer service! This is the 2nd pair of mejuri earrings I own. The jury is still out on the quality but I do like the customer service Ive had in both, Philly and Calgary stores.

"Im happy with the jewelry I purchased and the customer service I received from the sales associates, but am disappointed with the lack of professionalism from the piercer. She was 25 minutes late to my scheduled appointment and she also told me the incorrect price for some of the jewelry I wanted, so I ended up spending more than I had expected. I only realized this after checking the receipt in my email inbox, which arrived after I left the store, and when I called back to get clarification on pricing, all the piercer said was that she was sorry that she must have incorrectly memorized the pricing. For the amount I spent on jewelry and the hour I drove to get to my appointment on time (since theres only a 10-minute grace period), I expected more from Mejuri. Based on my experience, I will likely not be visiting again any time soon and would not recommend the piercing studio at this location.",Bethesda,0.0,2024-11-10,3,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,"

"Super nice & personable staff! But the quality of the Jewlery is really questionable…. Ive had issues with now 2 pairs of earrings from them & with the price point it wouldnt really make sense to pay almost $300 for a pair of earrings that just fall off your ear after 1-2 months of wearing them. Also gotta kick rocks if you do because warranty doesnt cover that! The make and quality is just, weird? White gold but I dont know…. Cheap white gold? Ive never had earrings just fall off my ear. The earring backings on most of their earrings are so cheap looking and cheaply made. For the earrings that clasp on, they just arent made the best so the clasp ends up not… clasping.. They suggest to buy plastic earring backings from Amazon to help keep them in. But Id hope if I buy a diamond gold earring the earring would kinda stay in my ear, ya know? 5/5  location, 5/5  customer service/staff, 2/5  Jewlery quality, just go for the rings Id stray away from earrings",Bethesda,0.0,2024-12-10,4,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,"

"Mejuri is based in Toronto, Canada and has made itself known for its fine and semi fine jewelry. Mejuri offers a large range of accessories from Diamond rings to Amethyst bracelets, carefully crafted with sustainable materials.As someone who loves fine jewelry but understands the importance of budgeting I love how Mejuri is so budget friendly starting at just 35$. Mejuri is a step in the right direction for luxury jewelry that is both accessible and sustainable.Having worn multiple of Mejuris pieces, Ive found them to be quite modern yet elegant. This jewelry is luxurious, sustainable, and practical for everyday wear.Some pros of Mejuri are its affordable price, quality materials, and sustainability but it does have a few cons. Some pieces are less durable and dont last as long as some of the more expensive pieces and some people find it to have too little range of styles.Mejuris products are aimed towards people with more modern values of quality and ethical purchasing. Its for the people who want some luxury to their lives without having the quilt of being too extravagant.The shopping experience at Mejuri is straightforward with a user friendly website and clear descriptions of products. Alternatives to Mejuri that fit its ethical and quality standards are Catbird and Blue Nile.Overall I would give Mejuri 5 stars for its commitment to making quality and ethical luxury jewelry. Although it might not fit everyones style its a compelling option for those looking for cheap, sustainable, and quality luxury jewelry.",Bethesda,1.0,2024-06-10,5,"7247 Woodmont Ave, Bethesda, MD",MD,"

"I had a terrible experience with Mejuri. The first pair of earrings I bought was defective—the clasp on one wouldnt open, and it got stuck in my ear. When I finally managed to get it off to send it back as a defective product, they had the audacity to claim the earrings werent in the box. Whether it fell out due to their mishandling or they didnt properly check, thats on them. Why would I keep defective earrings?Still, I decided to give them another chance and ordered a new pair. The same issue with the clasp happened again. This time, I checked the clasps immediately after opening, and they went right back in the box and were shipped back. Mejuri then claimed the earrings were in ""bad condition"" and refused to refund me—even though they never left the box for more than a few seconds.This company operates like a scam. Their return process and customer service are appalling. Save yourself the frustration and stay far, far away.",,3.0,2025-01-13,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,"

"This is not the first time I bought a jewelry in Mejuri. I always order online and have it deliver to my place. When I heard they opened a store in Montreal I got excited thats why this time I decided to pick up my order and check out the store. And I just did today, I bought a mini hoop 14k yellow gold, it is actually my second mini hoop. But I noticed the mejuri tag is missing and I dont see the 14k unlike the old mini hoop I have. As you can see in the photo, the one on the right is the first one I bought few months ago there is a tag on the side while the one on the left has none. I was told by an agent I can have it exchange because there should be a Mejuri tag :(11/30/2024 Update:I went back to the store this morning and one of the staff said  the law dont allow them anymore to make the hallmark or tag to be easily visible. She pointed a super tiny marking inside. It is so small, so hard to see and read even with a magnifying glass.

"Subpar customer service. The return policies are all over the place and the employees are unknowledgeable about their own job and procedures. Returned an item in person that I received as a gift and was told that a physical gift card was not possible as they dont do gift cards (however online they state they have gift cards). They made me make an account and said the store credit will be transferred there, however I later found out that the store credit was never transferred there. I called the store explaining the situation and said that the store credit could only be given to the person who ordered the jewelry and could not be sent to me directly. So, I made an account for no reason and the employee who helped me in person had no clue what they were doing either. I had to bother my aunt for the store credit, I gave them her email, but after a day she never received an email containing the store credit. I called the following day and explained she never got it, and they sent the store credit to my email directly. I had to go through many unnecessary hoops when it could have been avoided if a) they sent me the store credit directly from the start and if b) they trained their employees properly and hired people with at least half a brain.",,0.0,2025-01-10,2,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,"

"My sister and I have been return customers to Mejuri since this summer. I bought my sister a necklace for her birthday gift from Meijuri. We visited the store in Montreal on Dec 26 at 2:30pm.  She wanted to exchange the  necklace for a bracelet. The necklace was a 50th bday gift for Nov 7 and this was the first opportunity to exchange since one of us lives in Toronto. The service we received was so horrendous that we left determined never to return.  The salesperson was rude, unhelpful and arrogant. As repeat customers, the exchange my sister wanted to make would have provided Meijuri with a higher profit but we were immediately referred to the «30 day limited exchange policy» with no opportunity to explain the situation.

"Problem number 1# 14K gold fades the gold sheen with in a month and half just from sweat and exposure to air. Jewellery is meant to be worn. They should consider protective coating for longevity and durability. which the Jewellery does not have.I bought the garnet and gold ring. The fading was a fate I had accepted for an $800 ring. I shouldnt have because $800 could get you 22k rings which would have resell value. But the choice is yours.Problem number 2# Damages easy. I got a second ring for $515 the croissant ring. Wore it once. When buying it I asked if I am able to return this if I dont like it tomorrow, the sales rep responded yes.I came back to find out this wasnt eligible for a return because theres a slight scratch (invisible to my eye but they apparently have equipment in the store). I was only give the option to exchange. I told her that it did not make sense she is taking back the ring anyway but not letting me take the money back. Pretty scamy since mejuri swears on sustainability and using recycled gold and silver upto 90+ %. Store manager with red hair mentions the store will not be able to sell it and LOSE money. And she was sorry the sales rep had a miscommunication and did not tell me the conditions of return especially when I asked if I will be eligible to return.This wont  reach you, but Sales reps. I know you need to upsell a product at a store and offer advise but when people give you their budget please be accomodatingand not confuse them with more expensive choices. At mejuri we spend a lot of money for a product that wont give us the joy for long. You guys are the last hope. I walked away today saying your miscommunication cost me $500.

"Its not a great experience is it? When youre buying they always tell you all about the refund/exchange flexibility and warranties and wonderful perks wow what a respectable store youd think.And then lo and behold, they sell you a defective earring and you gift it to someone and they open it and try it on right in front of you and a group of people, only to realize the earring doesnt clip… What an embarrassing situation to be put in the first place, for something valued 650$+! Seriously…And of course when you go back right away to return it, they refuse! Suddenly theyre all about valuing quality and thoroughly checking their products. Where was this diligence when I was going home with the product? Where was the thoroughness and attention to detail then?Be very careful when youre shopping from this store. Do a quality check before purchasing anything - or better yet dont purchase anything they are incompetent thieves.",,15.0,2024-02-10,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,"

"Recently visited the Mejuri store on Peel St. in Montreal. It was a wonderful experience namely because of the attentive and professional service received from one of their staff called Ella. She was very patient, very knowledgeable and with a great sense of fashion. I went in to get a birthday gift for my daughter and ended up getting her more than one, had my friend also get some jewellery and we ended up going the day after for more items for ourselves!

"Buyer beware :I received 2 sets of earrings as a present from Mejuri. I wanted to exchange them for another style. I went to the store and the store manager said that they have to do a quality check on the items. To my surprise, the earrings did not pass the check. I explained to the store manager that I simply tried the earrings for about 5 min before safely packing them away. I told them that maybe the items were sold to us that way however the store manager insisted that I brought back faulty items. It was definitely a horrible customer experience.Do not purchase from Mejuri unless you have tried the item in advance.

"I received a beautiful diamond  Riviera bracelet as a gift a little less than a year ago.  I now find it a little tight and I contacted customer service recently. After a lot of back and forth I was told there is nothing they can do without the receipt.  I cannot get the receipt as it was a gift from a previous employer. ALL I WANTED was to purchase a couple of extra links for the bracelet, but they said it was not possible. They told me the best solution was to return the item for credit and repurchase a larger size, but they couldnt do that without the receipt.

"Buyer beware:I bought a necklace and pendant for my wife recently at that store. She really loved it but unfortunately it was too small so about 2 weeks later she went to the store to exchange it for something else. She was very excited to do so as she really liked Mejuris products.To her shock, the store refused to take back the necklace arguing that it was not up to their required standard for a return. My wife explained that the necklace was only worn for about 5 minutes to try it on before she decided it was too small. There were no visible issues to us, no scratches or anything of that nature. The staff simply said they did a test and the necklace had lost its shine. We tried to explain that whatever issues they think there is with the necklace, it was sold to me in that same condition. No success. It was as if we were trying to explain to them that we are not trying to scam them or something. It was a humiliating experience.I contacted customer service online, explained the situation and sent them pictures of necklace. They agreed that it was in perfect condition and sent me a return label. I had to then go through the hassle of shipping it back myself and wait a couple of weeks for reimbursement.Unless you are buying something for yourself and know for certain that you will not in any scenario want to return the item, buy at your own risk because there is no guarantee the store will accept their product back even if it is in perfect condition.",,14.0,2024-02-10,1,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,"

"EDIT:Since writing this review, Mejuri has really made a big effort to right a wrong which is very much appreciated. They were having inventory issues and couldnt send me the backings. They sent me the piece I was missing as soon as possible and even sent me a gift for the unfortunate inconvenience I had went through.—————————————-I got a piercing during the opening weekend at the Montreal store back in January. I was told that I was going to get another follow-up appointment 2 months later to resize the flat back stud once the swelling went down.It seems they only had a piercer for the opening weekend because they no longer have a piercer to do the follow up appointment that was included with my purchase. I have called and I have visited the store and each time they say they are really close to hiring a piercer professional and that they cant give me the resized flat back stud because only a professional can handle it since it must be sanitized. I had left my contact information with them saying that they would reach out to me as soon as a piercer was available but, never heard back.I finally decided to contact the Custom Happiness Team and they said they would follow up with me and that I can always set up an appointment at their Toronto location. Another two weeks pass by and still no resolution. Unless the travel expenses would also be included in my follow-up appointment in Toronto, I am getting the sense that I am being placated time and time again without them actively trying to resolve their mistake.I find this highly irresponsible that Mejuri would offer a service for their opening weekend without making sure their clients would have the proper aftercare.",,2.0,2024-02-10,4,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,"

"Mejuri is a hit or miss - I love all my rings and bracelet, but beware of earrings. I have different sizes of hoops and they have the worst clasps. Bought, along with my mother the Pavé Medium Hoops for my birthday and after wearing them twice, lost one on my third wear!! When trying them on in store, I had asked the sales rep regarding the clasp, but she said it was fine, that sometimes you need to clip it harder. Half of $600+tx down the drain. Heartbroken.Edited:As a customer who had raised the issue with the sales representative, who assured me there was no issue with the earring, Mejuri still blames me for the loss of the earring. Train your employees better. Craft your jewelry better. Very disappointed with the service.Also avoid the piercing studio! I have 12 piercings, 2 from here and both have gotten infected. The piercer also didnt have the proper equipment, so had trouble aligning the needle with the piercing, which resulting in playing around to get it to fit until I couldnt take the pain anymore and we decided to repierce the hole.",,14.0,2024-02-10,2,"1410 Peel St, Montreal, Quebec, Canada",,"

"Following the review of opening hours on Google, On January 4, 2025 my friend and I showed up at Mejuri on Stanley at 10:00 am only to end up hitting our noses on the door. The (male) employee inside was waving at us to leave but we didnt really understand why. So we stayed in front of the door until an employee finally decided to come see us to explain that the store finally opened at 11:00. A company of the size of Mejuri should have the correct opening hours on the sites visited by their customers. Very disappointing.

"The customer service here is subpar. Its a busy location, so I wasnt expecting to be greeted by anyone. However, when I shared with a sales associate that a pair of my gold vermeil earrings from Mejuri had tarnished after only a couple of wears, she told me that thats what gold vermeil pieces do and I shouldve purchased solid gold jewelry. Her tone and attitude were condescending, and she didnt even try to pretend to help. Mejuri prides itself in the affordable gold vermeil pieces that do NOT tarnish easily, so I am puzzled as to why their sales associate did not stand behind the brand. Since then I only purchase solid gold jewelry, but from other brands.",North York,1.0,2024-12-10,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU OR YOUR BUSINESS.They attempted to host an exclusive event for M+ members on Nov 10,2024 at Yorkdale and failed the set capacity limits on the number of people who could rsvp to the event. We showed up at our designated time slot only to find hundreds of people lined up on a first come first serve basis.There was no order to the chaos.We were given mixed information but several different employees. One blonde girl only knew how to apologize she didnt really provide any help or answer questions. Another asian girl with blonde hair said someone would come through the line to take orders for people who knew what they wanted. And that did not happen. By the time someone else said there was a separate line to order outside the store that was after 1.5 hours of already waiting in the line. There were people making returns and ordering things online for pick up despite this being an after hours event. The mall closed at 7pm why are they taking regular transactions at the time of this special event. People were see skipping and hopping in and out of line.The girl (who said she was new she started in July) manning the line could not get through the entire line in over 2.5 hours because she kept on checking some peoples tickets then running back into then came out minutes later just to check a few more people and would continuously forget where she left off. If she just kept going through the line a lot of misinformation would not have been spread around and it would have made her available sooner to help people check out. She also did not actually check everyones ticket either some people around us didnt get checked. Once your ticket was verified there was no way to confirm that at the door, not that they were checking. So people hopped in and out of line after she checked that part of the line. Then after she was eventually done checking the line after 2hrs and 45 min, she didnt contribute to helping any other customers she just chatted with people in line. She also had the good sense to bring out 3 drinks for 3 people when there was still 2 dozen people who hadnt had any drinks. So not really sure why she was put in charge of manning the line she did an extremely poor job of it.They eventually started handing out drinks to the customers in line 2 hours into the wait and then the people at the end of the line had to wait 45 minutes to get their drinks because the person handing out drinks needed a break supposedly. I wasnt aware that handing out drinks required a specific skill set they were non alcoholic.The manager refused to come out to address any customers and said he had no power to do anything. There was no apology or consideration at all and definitely no customer service experience at all. So Im not sure what your purpose is if youre a manager of a store and cant fix any customer issues or make any helpful decisions.I had a 7pm time slot and i saw people who had later time slots than me at 730 and 8 get helped and get items before me.Do not be fooled by Mejuri and their shiny objects, they have no common sense, no customer service experience, no competence. Especially at Yorkdale as well which is supposed to represent a client focused luxury experience mall.The photo attached does not show the line that went towards mac cosmetics to banana republic and then back and down all the way to babaton. You can see there is just a mass amount of people standing around the front of the store as well with no line organization or employees to organize these people which also created a safety hazard since the store is really not that big either.The event was supposed to be from 7-9 and i selected a 7pm time slot and after waiting over 2.5 hours I walked away without going into the store and a lot of disappointment.As someone who has spent quite a bit of money at Mejuri and who advocates for small businesses especially local to Toronto I am very disappointed by entire experience and will not be a returning customer.",North York,1.0,2024-12-10,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

"While on my way to an appointment, I decided to remove my necklace which I purchased on Mejuris online store and put it in my pocked. Unfortunately, when I took the necklace out of my pocket I discovered that part of the chain got tangled. I tried my best to untangle the chain but was unsuccessful due to the tight nature of the tangle, so I decided to stop by the Mejuri store in Yorkdale to see if they could help me out.I can assure you that my experience at the Mejuri Yorkdale far exceeded my expectations. Upon entrance, I was kindly greeted and they wasted no time trying to untangle the chain. In the end, Paola was successful in untangling the chain and went above and beyond by providing me with a new gift-box, a polishing cloth and a small tote bag. She also provided me with great advise on how to take care of my necklace. Although the store got busy, Paola didnt seem to be in a rush to get to the next customer, but took her time to ensure that I was being cared for and even went above and beyond which demonstrated excellent customer service.I am beyond satisfied with my experience at the Mejuri Yorkdale store and would visit again.",North York,0.0,2024-09-10,5,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

"Bought 2 gold stacker rings. Paid over 200.00 and when I received them I was not impressed. They were horrible. I put them on and knew immediately they would be returned. The quality was terrible.not worth the money.so I returned them in the same packaging they came in and requested my refund. Well today I received an email telling me that because I took a tiny label off them and because they were scratched I would not be getting a refund!!!! Are you kidding me? If these rings were scratched then I received them that way. I had them on for all of 5 minutes. They were so thin they looked like thread around my finger. As for the string with a tiny label on it, this company can simply put another on and all is good. I have spent many dollars at this store and have never had a problem, however this has done me in. Never gonna shop there again and I will start the process to fight for my right for a refund.

"1/5  Stars - Disappointing Experience with Mejuri Im writing this review as a cautionary tale for others. In July, I visited the Mejuri store in Yorkdale Mall, Toronto, to purchase a wedding ring set. I tried on several styles and ended up buying a wish bone ring set for around $600 after tax. The sales associate assured me that my ring size was 6, and I trusted that the rings I received were the correct size. However, when I opened the box on my wedding day, I was shocked to find that the rings were too big. To make matters worse, the customer service experience was appalling. I sent emails and received responses from at least 4-5 different people, including one who even got my name wrong! They eventually offered to let me return the rings for store credit, but we werent comfortable sending the rings back by mail and dealing with the uncertainty of the process. We took the rings to our local jeweler, who confirmed that the rings were actually a 7.5 - almost 2 sizes bigger than my correct size. Now were out of pocket for resizing the rings. But the final straw was when our jeweler called to inform us that during the cleaning process, ALL OF THE DIAMONDS fell out of the rings! Were talking about a supposedly high-quality piece of jewelry from a trendy brand, and it cant even hold its stones in place. Its unconscionable. Im extremely disappointed in Mejuris quality control and customer service. What should have been a special and memorable experience turned into a frustrating and costly ordeal. I would not recommend Mejuri to anyone.",North York,1.0,2024-10-10,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

"Disappointing experience with purchasing jewelry from Mejuri. My excitement quickly turned into disappointment as the items I purchased failed to meet even the most basic expectations.The overall quality of the jewelry was shockingly low. We pay this amount of money and expect to have a good quality Jewelry, or at least normal quality that we can wear them couple of times, but no! I didnt even wear the ring ONCE!! and now I cannot return it because it passed the 30 days. Color changing exactly happened to my necklace as well after wearing it once and I naively thought it cannot happen to my other purchases since it is too disappointing for this brand and this price. The pieces seemed more like costume jewelry than the elegant accessories I had hoped for.

"I would like to provide feedback regarding a recent interaction I had with one of your staff members. During a visit to Mujuri, I encountered an issue when I requested tissue paper to wrap a purchase, intending it as a gift. Despite observing another customer receiving tissue paper with their purchase just ahead of me, the staff member I approached stated that none was available and dismissed my request without further assistance. This interaction left me feeling overlooked as a paying customer, especially since I witnessed another customer receiving different treatment moments earlier.While I understand this may seem minor, the discrepancy in service made a notable impact on my experience at Mujuri. Consequently, I have chosen not to make any further purchases from your establishment.

"Edit:The social media team was much more responsive and helpful. They sent me a new pair of earrings and finally rectified the situation after two years. If you have an issue with the quality of the item you bought, I suggest you reach out to their social media team instead.Save your money and do not shop here! Their customer service is TERRIBLE!!! I spent $1,800 on my first visit at Mejuri. One of the earrings I was sold was faulty - the clasp on the hoop earring kept coming undone while I was wearing it. As a result, one of the earrings fell down the drain. When I contacted customer service, they said there was nothing they could do about it since the earring was lost. This logic is flawed because had the earring not been lost DUE to it being faulty, then they would have replaced the earring? I will never shop here again and I would encourage everyone else to buy from a company that values their customers.

"I drove from London to this store today so that I could try on a list of rings I had. I am an active Mejuri customer and was willing to spend a considerable amount of money here, as this was a gift for my 10 year wedding anniversary. The store itself is truly beautiful, and the first person who helped us out was very friendly (the second person was not). However, only two of the 6 rings I had come to try were available to try on in the store. For one of the rings, the employee couldnt even find it, nor had heard of it. I pulled it up on the website to show her and she basically just said that it must be discontinued 🤷‍♀️ Now, this wouldnt have been too much of an issue if I hadnt tried all week leading up to this visit (almost 3 hrs drive) to call the store to check if they had the rings I wanted to try on. No one ever answered, and I also left a voicemail requesting a callback. I had a completely wasted trip to this store all because no one would answer the phone. 6 hours round trip I will never get back. If you live nearby, sure, go visit this store because its pretty. But if youre looking for the same or even similar selection that you get online, dont bother.

"Went to their Yorkdale store to buy earrings as a Christmas gift.  The store was naturally busy during this time of the year.  What was disappointing is the place was fairly disorganized, there were no lineups, it felt like whoever is the loudest and who the sales member want to help is the deciding factor.  I was 1 of 2 men in the store and the sales team refused to make eye contact with me in order to get their attention to help.  I waited for about 20mins and they skipped me and started helping the ladies behind me.  Instead of making a scene since I know how short staff they are, I decided to leave and write this review.",North York,1.0,2024-02-10,2,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

Grace reviewed the earrings with me and informed me of the 2 year warranty that would cover my case, and they were replaced on the spot.

Deeply disappointed in your company. Firstly my earrings broke 3 times and the last time I had to change them to a cheaper one with a more reliable clip. Then I decided to use credit and ordered another earrings and paid for fast shipping. When I was ordering the system showed that the shipping takes 1-3 business days which I counted should be enough to deliver it before I leave the country. Once I placed the order system showed me that  there will be also a processing time and my order will be probably delivered 2-3 days later than it was shown before.

"Have visited the store twice, on two different occasions. On both occasions no one was very welcoming at all. The first time was ok, the manager at the front concierge it seems like was very nice and sociable! The second time I came when it wasnt quite busy, as there was no line like there usually is. Everyone seems pretty done with their lives and didnt really pay me any mind. The associate I dealt with did the absolute bare minimum to look for a size for me and help me with my request. She made me feel a bit uncomfortable and I felt a bit pressured into buying the product. She even handed me the phone to do her job which is asking me basic details that were already in the system. I got what I wanted but since I know my size I would just go online from now on, with the retail front not being very helpful and a bit cold. For such a brand that is all about diversity and positivity, there was a great lack of it on the retail front. I hope they improve their overall customer service experience in the future! :)EDIT:The jewelry tarnishes so fast! I bought a pair of sterling silver earrings and didnt put them away ""properly"", which is just sitting in a drawer, and they tarnished so badly! What a waste of my money.

"Not a great buying experience, felt kinda isolated in the store- maybe because Im a man and the store caters mostly to women and couples. I was looking at some mens jewelry and the person helping did not even crack a smile and gave very little information about the design and if there were any other similar options. Aside from the final associate handing me the necklace, the other people working there didnt even acknowledge me or make eye contact, while they kept welcoming and saying goodbye to other guests enthusiastically.When I went back to talk to the initial associate behind the counter to compare the necklace I bought, I was ignored while she helped 2 couples that came after me, until I interjected and said I would like some help. After waiting about 15mins, I finally got some help. Overall, a very isolating and negative buying experience in-person, Id probably just stick to the website and have it shipped. Horrible, horrible customer service experience, and it makes sense that they are mostly an online retailer.",North York,8.0,2023-02-10,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

"Delighted to see the store inside yorkdale. Ive seen so much advertisement and wanted to see what they had to offer. Immediately felt uncomfortable as EVERY SINGLE sales associate, supervisor, keyholder or manager if they had any on their phone. I mean I did a walk around to see what products were displayed, my mother wanted to try one of the piece. I felt repelled to ask anyone to see if we could try them on. I walked up to them and asked anyways. The lady looked up and said Everything is sanitized after each use, so just try (But there were other customers who were trying and putting the items back where it was found without being cleaned..?) than proceeded to do whatever she was doing on her phone. We walked out. I guess it was just all hype? I wouldnt recommend. Save your time and go to real brands like Cartier.

"Edit:Their team reached out over email and made great effort to invite me back and fix the situation. Changing to 3 stars.New to the Mejuri brand and I love a lot of the mens jewelry designs. But hoping corporate sees this review so the company can improve its customer service experience from online to in store:Whats the point of having your customers book an online styling appointment, fill in information on the specifics they need help with and the specific items they want to see, then to show up at your appointment and the staff in store have no information about anything you wrote down?It kinda kills the point of even having an online appointment system. When it comes to luxury goods like jewelry, the experience of purchasing the item is just as important as the item itself.I came in on time for my appointment expecting to see a few specific items (and wanted to buy them if they looked just as good IRL as online). Then I ended up waiting 20-30 minutes while the employee went back and forth to the back of the store telling me ""oh we cant find this, we cant find that. I can only bring you one item a time,"" then proceed to not talk to me at all while Im trying things on when she finally ends up finding the items (back room need better organization?). I ended up leaving before I even saw all the items I wanted cuz it was comical how bad the customer service experience was lol.Maybe the employees dont get commission so they dont care as much. Im not expecting a Chanel or Van Cleef level of customer service, but at least something on par with Apples organizational system where info is actually passed along would be great.",North York,3.0,2024-02-10,3,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

My boyfriend and I went to Yorkdale mall  to look for a gift for my birthday  it was yesterday June 18th.As we walk around we came across at the MEJURI store we saw a line up and wanted to check it out.My boyfriend liked these pair of Pavé Diamond Bold Huggie Hoops and he purchased them for me.I wore it at work today to show everyone I almost lost one because the clasp was defective.Furious  beyond words.I tried to call them today left several messages no one returned my calls.Got a hold of the live chat who tells me to ship the earrings back so I could get a new pair shipped to me.Terrible customer service and the company has not standard or customer service.I was better off going into Tiffany and be satisfied than upset.Wont visit this store ever again…..😝I wont recommend you will be very upset go elsewhere and invest your money in better quality.Should have checked the reviews no wonder why the rating is so low 👎.,North York,1.0,2024-02-10,1,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

My wife and I went in around 7 pm and purchased 2 bracelets as a gift, but the sales associate made a mistake and scanned the wrong one, which I didnt notice until I received my order. Mistakes happens, but I was disappointed when I pointed out the error to the manager of the store, who looked irritated (Id assume that she was the manager because shes the only wearing a black top as opposed the the sales associate who took my order who wears white). The customer service was extremely poor. To make matters worse, I had to go back to the store after leaving because they didnt include a gift receipt, which I had specifically requested during my purchase.

"Pretty unhappy with my experience here.Came in to return something and initially had to wait 5 min while the employee was doing something on their phone before they acknowledged me.Was then told that I wasnt able to do a return, it could only be done online. On my way out I verified the return policy and decided to speak to the manager. I had to wait twenty minutes for her to tell me I shouldve read the email where it states that because it was a ""momentmaker"" item it couldnt be returned in store but because I was here shed do it for me.Except a special return policy isnt mentioned in any of the emails or on their site at all.  she had me show her because ""I wasnt looking in the right place"". Except I was right. There is no mention of a special policy anywhere on their site or emails.

"I never write reviews because theyre a waste of time. But Ive never been this upset with retail before. Bought a bracelet as a gift for a friend and it broke after one day. Wanted a refund because it was clear the design of the bracelet was the cause. Mejuri Yorkdale would not accept a refund and said I have to exchange it for the same bracelet when I know it will break again. I had to fight to get it exchanged for a different design and they also made it final sale. Why would someone want the same item if it broke after one day. Also, the manager at the Yorkdale mall who claims she has a lot of experience in the jewelry industry even went as far as blaming my friend for wearing it to sleep (bracelet broke overnight and was found next morning in bed). Blaming their customer is one of the most unprofessional things you can do in retail. The bracelet shouldnt be this bad quality to break after one night anyway.

Went up to go and pay for it (easy sale), and a manager was there with another associate talking, they both looked up, saw us waiting (RIGHT in front of them) and went back to their conversation about sales targets and how to greet customers....like maybe MAKE the sale right in front of you first?

"Went in about 2 weeks ago alone to try on a size of a ring so I know to tell my partner for any potential gifts. The girl that helped me was so rude, barely even looked at me , didnt tell me sizes when I asked what size of a ring i was trying her response was I think a 4 and then continued to be on her phone. I felt judged because at that moment I wasnt going to buy and the sales person was not even nice through the experience because she probably knew I wasnt going to purchase. It actually made me not want to come back to the store because of the pure rudeness of some of these girls.

"Nice and cool store.- The lack of price next to the models is painful. For each of the prices, we have to ask the sellers and they spend some time looking for the price on their phones, and finally the selection and purchase process becomes difficult.- The names to find on the website are very similar and the sizes are listed on the website with different names. Thats why its hard to choose.- After shopping, when we had to wait for packaging, there wasnt a chair to sit or a sofa to rest on.These little things can improve the shopping experience.I hope they make the purchase process easier.",North York,1.0,2024-09-10,3,"3401 Dufferin St, North York, ON, Canada",ON,"

"1 star is generous for this business.During Black Friday, my husband purchased two pairs of earrings for me. The items arrived on December 5th, but the sapphire earrings were dull and poor in quality. I filed a return the same day, and the package was shipped back shortly after.A week later, I received an email stating my refund was only $76.28, despite paying $184.76. The return receipt (1st photo) showed the discount was incorrectly applied twice. When I contacted Mejuri, they claimed one pair was ""scratched"" and unsellable, attaching a photo as evidence (2nd photo). However, their original return email made no mention of any scratch issue. Luckily, I had taken photos before returning the items, which clearly show no scratches.This is unacceptable and unethical behavior from a business. Ive attached my photos, their photo, and the return receipt for others to judge before deciding to shop here.",Toronto,0.0,2025-01-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

I have deleted my review for Alannah as she is no longer working at Mejuri. The customer service at this location is atrocious! They are openly rude to their customers and I just discovered that my wishbone ring has lost a diamond. Horrible craftsmanship for the price I Sadly paid for this thin little ring. My Advice - go to any other jewellery store but this one. The prices are outrageous and not worth it. The prices have all gone up a lot and nothing is worth the price increases.

"It was my first time visiting a Mejuri store. On August 23rd, 2024, I purchased a stud as a gift for a friend and booked a piercing appointment for August 25th. However, when my friend and I arrived on Sunday, we were informed that my appointment was not in the piercers calendar. Thankfully, I had taken a screenshot of the booking confirmation, which eventually allowed us to secure the 4:40 pm slot.Unfortunately, this situation led to a heated conversation with the piercer, Ella, who was quite rude to both my friend and me. During our conversation, I had to address her passive aggressiveness. Even when I spoke with the store manager, Ella continued to continuously interrupt us, adding to the frustration. This entire experience left a very bitter taste, and I ultimately decided not to go through with the piercing.Given how things transpired, I am considering returning the piece of jewelry I purchased and am hesitant to visit the Ossington store again.I hope this feedback helps improve future customer experiences and ensures that situations like this do not happen.",Toronto,2.0,2024-09-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

We showed up on time for our appointment for piecing and were asked to wait. When we were finally served we were told that there was not enough time to do the procedure because someone else was coming in and they didnt want to push them back even though they pushed our appointment. The piercing technician told us he didnt actually wouldnt work late because it wasnt fair to other people.

"I have spent a lot of money at Mejuri this year. Typically the quality is good and the pieces are stylish. However, repeatedly Ive been at the ossington location and I find the staff to be outright rude. Customer service goes a long way, especially when youre selling pieces that attract the price tags at Mejuri. I expect better from the staff. Mejuri you really should do a quality assurance check of the staff at this location as it happens more often than it doesnt.

"I had two frustrating visits to Mejuri this week that left me highly disappointed. On my first visit, I witnessed an elderly woman struggling to enter the store with a walker while three sales associates stood nearby chatting without offering any assistance. As for my own experience, I called ahead to check if a bracelet was in stock and was told it would be held for me (was told the hold was approved by a manager and the sales associate took down my information). However, when I came in later that day, I was informed that the bracelet had been sold despite the prior agreement, and no effort was made to help me resolve the issue.A few days later, I called again to inquire about another item. After some back and forth, I was told they might have it in stock. When I asked to confirm the sales associate told me I can look if you want but it will take a while - If I am coming into the store I want to make sure the item is in stock. I was told they couldnt hold it for me, despite a prior associate having told me they can hold an item for me just days earlier. I also inquired about engraving a ring (was told the machine was down that day but would be running the following day).  When I arrived in store I was told machine was still broken—something I was never informed of by other stores, which had sent me to the Ossington location in the first place. The engraver has been down for months according to a sales associate.  The solution provided was that I keep checking back in the new year and hopefully it would be running.  This item was supposed to be a gift and now I will have to source and pay for the engraving.The communication between staff members was horrendous, and the lack of customer service was shocking. I wont be returning, and I wont be recommending this store to anyone.",Toronto,1.0,2025-01-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"Purchased a rope chain and only wore it a few times until the clasp broke. Mejuri would not honor the warranty even though it was within the warranty period. This is certainly not fine jewelry it is simply cheap jewelry. You are better off purchasing cheap gold chains that are easily replaceable, or better to spend more for a higher quality brand. Wont buy anything from Mejuri again.Their response below tells you all you need to know. If your item breaks they will blame you for accidental damage or normal wear and tear (after wearing a few times to office). In contrast, I have a similar chain from another mid-level brand that is 20 years old. I wore it daily for years even to sleep, shower, sports, I still have that chain and the clasp is fine.

"After a terrible experience repairing my beloved sterling silver hoops a coworker suggested I look at Mejuri. I spent days deciding on an every day simple hoop. Due to an allergy to fake jewelry I have to wear real gold or silver. These sterling silver tube huggies were perfect! Placed my order online and went on a payment plan to make it financially easier. They were only about $50. A couple of days later to my surprise they arrived at my door and as I write this they havent been paid for in full! I chose an eco friendly packaging which I love that they had. The earrings came in a a simple box, white drawstring bag inside and in that bag a smaller black drawstring holding the hoops.

"Poor quality jewellery! I went into this store asking if there was something they could do about the clasp that came off a necklace I purchased from Mejuri, I understand the product was out of warranty but youd think for the price point the jewellery should last more than a couple of years. What was particularly disappointing was going in and being told ""your best bet would be to go to a jeweller to get this fixed"" confused, I looked around and asked ""isnt this a jeweller?"" The woman at the front counter shrugged it off and went back to what she was doing. If youre looking for good quality jewellery for a decent price point I recommend the nearby store Armed on Dundas. They have reasonable prices, their pieces last more than 2 years, and if something breaks theyll actually fix it for you as a good quality jeweller should.",Toronto,1.0,2024-07-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"I would recommend to go find other places if you want to get ear piercing. Some professional piercing studio with reliable service quality. I should have done my research and read the review before getting my piercing done here.I had good experience back then when this store was located on Dundas st. and when they used to bring a local piercing parlour to their store and throw so called a piercing party. So I decided to try their piercing studio this time.On a day before my piercing appointment, I checked their website for available piercing jewelry. I didnt want anything too fancy, so I went for my appointment with $98 ones in my mind. On the day, basically I had only 5 choices, 2 of the options were $128 each, others like $300+. Ok, $30 x2 over the budget was find enough, so whatever.When the time for my check up appointment approached, it got cancelled, rescheduled, and cancelled again. This time, they apparently dont have a piercer available.Will I go back for a new piercing? NEVER. Would I recommend to others? NEVER. Will I go back maybe for their jewelry? Not really.",Toronto,2.0,2024-02-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"I bought a ring for my girlfriend on Black Friday but it was the wrong size. When we came in a few days later to exchange it the sale had ended which would mean that I couldnt just pay the difference on the sale price, I would have to pay  (~$500) more. But after the associate spoke to her manager they honored the Black Friday price on the exchange, so I just paid $90 for the larger size ring. Very little push back, made me happy and we will come back to buy more jewelry from them in the future.Thanks again!",Toronto,0.0,2024-02-10,5,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"I will never shop at Mejuri again after dealing with the manager at this location.For Christmas, my mother got me a ring from this location but sadly it was slightly too small. When I went to exchange this ring, I brought all the receipt cards that my mom had been given, but they told me I couldnt exchange the ring.  The ring my mother bought was not associated with those order numbers.There was no record online as well that my mom bought this ring or that it was associated with her credit card.Long story short, after spending 2+ hours over the phone and in store trying to resolve this issue, we discovered that at the time my mom was checked out, she was checked out incorrectly for the wrong ring. We did not have the croissant ring (that ring has been discontinued), but was charged 98$ for it, and the ring we bought was the charlotte bold ring (128$).We were accused of stealing the ring multiple times even though their sales rep made a big mistake and admitted that that must have happened. Upon exchanging the ring we had the full packaging (bag and box and exchange/return tag) and all the receipt cards yet we were still accused by the sales rep and the manager.We were nice enough people to just pay the difference in price for the ring instead of arguing. But after being so disrespected by management at this location and the sales rep it is not worth giving your business.",Toronto,5.0,2024-04-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"If you plan to come here for ear piercing you might just walk out disappointed like I was. It took me over 4 months to get an appointment, and after spending 1.5 hours transit to get to the store, I was told that the earrings (first choice and second choice) I wanted were out of stock and they had no idea when they have it back. They only had a small handful of other options available and all of them were over my budget. It was a huge waste of time both waiting for an appointment and then to be told that they didnt have the selection I wanted (when it is available on their website). If I had known that you are at the mercy of whatever they have on hand that day I would never have made an appointment in the first place",Toronto,2.0,2024-02-10,1,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"My friend and I got our ears pierced at their former location earlier this year. Despite having several checkup appointments at the store and being assured our piercings were looking okay, we had complications with our piercings that required us to get them removed by a doctor. I wish we had just gone to a tattoo parlour to have them done since something like this is almost unheard of.I believe this is in part because of the poor quality of the earrings.

"Ive had some quality gripes with Mejuri lately- everything from my gold vermeil ring tarnishing while it was still relatively new, to my 14k diamond initial pendant literally snapping in half within 9 months of purchase. Unfortunately, they were not able to honour their product warranty, as they determined that what happened with my pendant was not a quality issue on their end. But I would have to contest that that was definitely not the case. Im sure its easy for companies to just blame things like this on wear and tear to refuse warranty, but for an expensive, 14K solid gold with diamonds piece, I REALLY expected better from Mejuri.Mejuri used to pride itself on being affordable, but youre better off searching for 14K solid gold pieces on Etsy from independent, reputable jewellers. A lot of their pieces are universal designs (i.e. croissant ring, beaded ring, paperclip necklace) so you just have to know how to search properly. This is the route Ive taken as of late and I havent had issues with any Etsy retailers.",Toronto,4.0,2024-02-10,2,"64 Ossington Ave, Toronto, ON, Canada",ON,"

"My wifes boyfriend suggested I get her some Croissant Dôme Hoops for our 2-year anniversary. I hate the fact that hes the one recommending stuff she likes — after all Im the one who married her. But, I have to say his suggestion came in clutch; especially after my predicament at the Mejuri Vancouver store last Summer.This Chicago location is properly my favourite Mejuri store Ive seen so far. The venue is very spacious, and the staff was super friendly. Between me and you, the Chicago staff was chill AF compared to Vancouver. Overall, I ended up spending more than I expected on the gift because I love their stuff so much.

Do not waste your money coming here. Gorjana stands by their pieces and when you are spending 100 dollars on jewlery pieces you expect them to last more than a few months. Ridiculous.

"I dont even know where to begin. A year ago I bought 2 pairs of gold and diamond earrings that totaled to over $1K. Within days the clasp on one loosened. Within 3 months they started to tarnish. Went in store to show them and received store credit so I bought 2 other pairs. Within 4 days the clasp bent on one of them and I almost lost it. I reached out at this point requesting a full refund although their policy only does store credit. I explained that if I have to respect their policy I expect them to respect my expectations that when I spend so much on earrings I want them to last. I went back and forth for months with different reps. You can only text or email, no phone calls and I dont live in Chicago, I am out of state. They initially denied the warranty completely. I continued to explain how the clasp on this expensive earring broke quicker than any of my cheap Amazon jewelry. Then they agreed to fully refund me once I sent the products back, which I did. Once they received my earrings they sent another email saying they changed their mind on the refund and I can only get store credit because the product was returned bent??? Yes exactly thats why I dont want it anymore, because your jewelry is so cheaply made it cant even last a week. I literally do not want anything to do with them anymore and do not want any of their crappy,  poor quality and overpriced jewelry.

"Extremely disappointed with the service at Mejuri. I was planning to purchase a diamond bracelet for holiday while having my necklace polished. When I got back the necklace it was tangling and unwearable. I asked one staff for help while shopping for the bracelet. The staff with a hair bang was rude and impatient. She quickly lost patience and hastily tried to dismiss me, claiming she was too busy to help with others(if you are someone who is a pro in the jewelry store couldnt fix it how come I can fix it???). When I asked to see the manager saying that I cant leave the store with a necklace like this, suddenly they quickly fix it with some magic. Overall BAD in-store service.

"I love Mejuri!  Ive been a longtime customer and purchased items online before they opened a store in Chicago.  Ive shopped at their Chicago location several times.  Its been wonderful seeing the jewelry in person and trying them on.  Each staff member has been so welcoming and helpful.  Today, I stopped in and was helped by Valerie.  She helped me find a bracelet that fits my wrist and lifestyle.  She mentioned that many of the employees are art and design students.  I think thats a wonderful hiring decision.  All the staff Ive met are wonderful and have an eye for design and style.  It would be great if the employees at this location could help Mejuri with marketing and social media opportunities!

"I recently had an unfortunate experience at this location. Last week, a friend and I visited to purchase some pieces we had been eyeing and participate in their early access sale, which was invite only. We visited this store as soon they opened because my friend was traveling later in the day, and wanted to take advantage of the sale before she left. Since there were no signs up about the early accesssale, we asked staff about it.Several staff (honestly, too many staff) repeatedly asked if we actually received the invitation. Despite the fact that we knew more about the sale than your own customer service, they repeatedly asked--seeming to question whether someone like my friend would have actually received it. It was extremely odd. Now this would have been fine, but for the fact that after asking again and again, they then said they couldnt help because the sale wasnt until 7pm and there was no way to provide us with access to the sale ahead of that time.If that was truly the case, I dont know why we would be asked again and again whether we actually received the email. My friend and I were also told that the store was understaffed and they would have difficulty assisting us at all.This was my first time in this store. And it left a terrible taste and impression on me, and the culture and values of Mejuri. Macys service is better.",Chicago,10.0,2024-02-10,1,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,"

"Hubby and I got new rings for each other as Anniversary gifts a couple of years ago. He picked a really nice black one, I think it was called the Kent. It came professionally wrapped and even included a great silicone one to wear if needed from time to time. It also has a warranty and I thought that was great. However, back in May of this year our Kia was taken by the self proclaimed ""Kia boys"" and his ring was in the arm rest (gym, weights etc). After filing a police report, we contacted Mejuri and explained the situation. We were politely told that although they were sorry for the circumstance, a lost ring isnt covered under the warranty. It only covers damages to rings that are still in possession. Mejuri also offered for us to look at some other rings they have in stock and quoted the discounts available at that time. Although we left that conversation ring less, CPD recovered our car by that evening AND the ring was still there. Overall, great product, great quality…just be careful to ask whats all covered in events such as theft of merchandise etc regarding warranties.",Chicago,2.0,2024-02-10,4,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,"

"Worth the time and money.  I went into the West Loop location this past Saturday for the first time, and I am very happy with my experience with Jackie.  I made an appointment to get my ears pierced ahead of time and had a general idea of what jewelry I wanted to be pierced with.  They have a section in the back, by the piercing studio for you to select the allotted studs they use to pierce.  I am glad I arrived 20 min early.  It gave me enough time to double check if the jewelry online were the same and it was.  They dont have an option to tip, so I would recommend bringing cash.  ( I dont tip ppl for everything, however this qualifies it) I was lucky Jackie had a client that came early, because I had some concerns with a 40 yr old piercing my parents had done for me at 2 months old.  The old one was so high on my lobe and close to my head, and she took great time, patience and care to show me why she chose the location and exact position.  Needless to say, but I will, corp. needs to allot 45 min as standard amount of time.        This IS a lux experience, and the short window given to the piercer and client, puts a lot of stress on both parties involved.  Mejuri needs to know how lucky they are to have Jackie, and her professionalism that saved the day for the limited time we had.  As for the rest of the staff, everyone had a caring smile, even the lovely security guard.",Chicago,0.0,2024-02-10,5,"940 W Randolph St, Chicago, IL, United States",IL,"

I wanted to buy a birthday gift for my friend so I wanted to go in store and get a gift receipt. I went on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite busy.

"We purchased our wedding bands at this location. The bands themselves are great. Our shopping experience was an unending hassle.Our first visit seemed alright. The store had opened recently, so they had very low stock. They didnt have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes that we could try on. They did have bands of other materials in those sizes, and they helped us size our fingers. Then we bought bands in those sizes to be shipped directly to us—not ideal, but we hoped the sizes wed pegged in-store were correct. They reassured us that, if either of us needed to move to a different size, the exchange process would be a breeze.It was not. While one of our initial rings was a success, the other needed a new size. Returning to the store to exchange it kicked off a months-long comedy of errors. The clerks for this visit had trouble at every step—finding our order, processing an exchange, checking stock. After a very long wait, it was confirmed the store still did not have stock of basic gold bands in average sizes, so we would have to essentially place an online order again. To prevent having to return to the store again, they recommended we order the next two half sizes so both could be tried on, one kept and one returned. From there the clerks had immense trouble processing an exchange, at one point turning the iPad around to show it wasnt going through the way they were trying—was that supposed to prompt an, I see, Ill just keep an expensive ring that doesnt fit then? Finally, they seemed to have been able to process the exchange and set up the two rings to ship to us.Except:we received no email confirmation of the exchange or shipment. We had to call Mejuri corporate, who were able to track down our order. Apparently the clerks had associated this new part of the order with a completely new customer account. While Mejuri corporate was able to find this, as a result for every subsequent step of the process—tracking the two new rings, returning the one that did not fit, receiving a refund for that ring—required going through Mejuri customer service.As I noted, we are happy with our rings. And Mejuris customer service on the web/phone are very helpful and prompt. Thus my experience at this store would lead me to recommend that customers simply do all shopping at Mejuri.com rather than in a store, and/or that Mejuri do a better job setting up its physical stores by having adequate stock and preparing their clerks for more situations than the simplest of sales.",Skokie,0.0,2025-01-10,2,"4999 Old Orchard Shopping Ctr Suite B34, Skokie, IL, United States",IL,"

"I got my ring Christmas before last, and only got to wear it twice before it started to tarnish (or what I thought was tarnish) terribly. I took it out today to clean it, and it doesnt really clean the spots- using a jewelry cleaning cloth- the gold started to chip off on the bottom and in the spots near the gem! And speaking of the gem, it also cracked on the corner on my second wear (last picture)! I was so hopeful for the opportunity to wear this gorgeous ring but its falling apart after only two wears.

My husband bought me a gold necklace from here for my bday about a month ago. Im a teacher (so is my hubby) and have a very sedimentary life. The clasp was always loose and the necklace kept falling off. It happened again and now I cant find it. Money down the drain. Im very upset about the quality of their jewelry and feel awful that my husband spent all this money for me not to have it A MONTH LATER. He even customized it with our wedding date :(I do not recommend this place.,Houston,2.0,2024-02-10,1,"888 Westheimer Rd Suite 158, Houston, TX",TX,"

"Absolutely horrible customer treatment, there is such poor quality of communication as well as lack of respect for the customer in order for them to truly justify their desired wishes to the employees. The environment is very assuming and totally makes the customer uncomfortable by being seen with much prejudice.

Lacking quite poorly to provide ultimate assistance and help with any questions or concerns the customer may have just like I did.

"Buyer beware! This is a nice storefront with good branding, but dont let that fool you. Their products arent great quality, they do not adhere to their posted policies, and they have abysmal customer experience. I bought merchandise from them in late November, and exchanged for different styles a week later. During that exchange, my transaction was rung as store credit + purchase rather than refund + purchase, without informing me that this nullified my ability to receive a refund, were I to return these items. A week later, I returned these items and was refused my money back, even though all items were unworn, with tags, and had been purchased 7 days prior. They acknowledged their mistake and my compliance with their policy. But they feigned helplessness, stating that the system couldnt support them refunding my full purchase amount. Even with 2 weeks of escalations to their leadership team, they still refuse to do the right thing.It is so disappointing to have a business not act in the best interests of its customers and to be so dishonest and unethical in their transactions. Ive filed a complaint with the better business bureau and advise anyone dealing with them to exercise extreme caution.

"Ive been a loyal Mejuri customer for years and have always enjoyed everything Ive purchased. About a year ago, I bought a sterling silver bracelet that I loved. Unfortunately, the clasp broke shortly after, so I went to the store to exchange it under warranty. I also needed to exchange a ring I had purchased because it wasnt the right metal for me.While the store associate and manager were very helpful, they had a hard time processing both returns in the same transaction, which ended up taking nearly an hour. When the associate brought out the replacement bracelet, it was a different metal than the one I originally bought. She explained that the bracelet had been updated due to issues with the clasp and that this new version was more expensive, but I was getting it at the original price. When I expressed my preference for a refund, the manager informed me that it wasnt an option, which left me feeling a bit trapped. In the end, I accepted the outcome.Despite this, I continued ordering online and had a great experience with all my other purchases. On my birthday yesterday, I visited the store and, to my surprise, saw the bracelet I originally ordered right on the counter. I explained my situation to Megan, who was helping with purchasing a new chain necklace. She noticed an exchange on my account and suggested that I bring in the bracelet so they could help me get the one I initially wanted and paid for.Before heading back to the store, I decided to call and speak with the store manager, John. He briefly explained that their system sometimes loses order information and that without the original order, they couldnt assist me. Unfortunately, they also couldnt find the warranty exchange that the previous manager had processed a year ago.Im very disappointed after being a loyal customer for so long, and will be taking my business elsewhere. I recommend you do the same.",Austin,3.0,2024-09-10,1,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,"

"I had a great time shopping and being pierced. The girls working the front were super nice and helpful.Miranda, let me tell yall, was the absolute best! Miranda is the piercer. She is incredibly knowledgeable, professional, kind, and fast. Ive been pierced before by other piercers, but never  have I been treated to such a lovely experience. Miranda was very personable, helping to put me at ease. She then asked what I wanted and giving a knowledgeable opinion on how we could achieve it.I got an upper lobe and a helix done. She was so fast! It took more time for her to set up her sterile station and me picking out jewelry than the actual start and finish of the piercings, and that didnt take long. You can tell she is very experienced by how confident in her movements she is. Miranda then ensured I loved them before going into great detail on how to care for them until they heal. All I can say to that is she just won a lifetime customer. Ill be recommending my friends and family (and everyone) who wants to get a piercing to go see Miranda.THANK YOU Miranda!!!!",Austin,0.0,2024-02-10,5,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,"

"I love Mejuris timeless jewelry and had been a fan of their online store long before I knew they had a location in the Domain. As with any store in the Domain, parking can be a pain if you just need to run in for something during a busy time, but the store itself is a breath of fresh air. Its so fun to see the pieces all together in person. The store is very calming and the check out process is seamless.  I also really enjoy that their stylists walk you through whats in your bag after you check out. Like explaining that theres a travel bag and cleaning cloth under the foam, or telling you what the little black strip is for. Its little but it just shows that they care and gives you an idea of how to take care of your jewelry instead of just assuming that youd know. I love the Mejuri has a range, from vermeil to solid pieces, at a really fair price. The pieces that I enjoy from them are timeless but modern. Ive bought a lot of gold from them over the years but just picked up my first Mejuri pearls (Bold Pearl Drop Earrings) and couldnt be happier with the earrings, the store, and the service I received while there.",Austin,0.0,2024-02-10,5,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,"

Ive never worn them or anything because I ended up finding a better pair from a different jeweler at the Domain. They accused of me scratching the earrings and only allowed me to return the pearl charms. I dont see how that was possible if they werent worn.

"A very interesting experience here last week, and hasnt been a positive representation of the company.Last week was getting coffee at Starbucks when two of the employees here were having a conversation. The taller blond, Got very loud at the Starbucks and was asked to go outside with the other lady with dark brown hair.I didnt think much until I came to look at some new pieces as Im an avid fan of Mejuri. The blond lady was present in store, but was not welcoming and had a smerk on her face. Possibly because she recognized me from Starbucks as she was asked to leave. I later found out that she was visiting from California and her name was Britney from my advisor.If Mejuri allows their upper management to talk to store staff this way, I will no long shop or recommend Mejuri. Unhappy people deserve jobs where they are not face to face with employees. Maybe she isnt face to face often, but a simple smile would change my experience in store. But witnessing her yelling and belittling the other employee at this location outside speaks very negative of this company that I have been a fan of.",Austin,3.0,2024-02-10,2,"11700 Domain Blvd Suite 126, Austin, TX",TX,"

"I should have read the reviews on more than one site. Apparently the clasps on the earrings dont hold. After wearing them to the car and into a store, my daughter realized one had fallen out. Since it was lost, they do not consider it a warranty issue and will not replace the one earring. She wore them twice. Your better off throwing 50 bucks out the window then buying their earrings. Now after the fact, Ive read numerous reviewers saying the same exact thing. Mejuri refuses to accept responsibility for faulty clasps. Also, I ordered 2 items for Christmas presents and they put them both in the same box. When I contacted them to ask for another box (gifts for 2 separate people), they said they were too busy to send another one out and that you have to select the gift option to get a box for each item.

"I recently visited with my sister in law and we were both so disappointed with how I was treated. I couldnt get help unless I begged, meanwhile the girls in the store were fawning over my SIL to the point that she was overwhelmed. I was dressed in leggings and a t shirt, while she was dressed very trendy. Shes also super small and beautiful, whereas I am of a larger build and wasnt done up. The difference in the way that I was treated was jarring - I had never experienced that. While shopping I was almost in tears because they seemed so annoyed and bothered by me, but were so kind to my SIL. When we walked out of the store, my SIL immediately said she noticed a difference in the way we were treated - proof that it was so bad.

Really excellent customer service. I had a super nice stylist today and her manager also helped with my account. The stylist picked out several pieces for me and showed me how they looked stacked. She also gave helpful tips on what to consider when stacking jewelry (eg consider the length of your jewelry at home; change the texture of the chain if the lengths are the same). I wish I could remember their names it was just earlier today! The stylist was a young Asian woman. In general everyone was very nice and the vibes at the shop were good. Would recommend. I bought a silver sapphire piece and it looks very cute; they told me to keep it shiny just use a polishing cloth and keep it in the bag.,Los Angeles,0.0,2024-09-10,5,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,"

"On May 14, I got piercing in Melrose location.The next day hell started. My ear doubled in size and was swollen, behind the ear was bruising and lymph nodes are inflamed! it was so painful that I could neither touch nor sleep from the pain. I thought its fine, its healing process, so 4 days on painkillers.But I couldnt stand  this pain anymore and returned to the store, took off the earring, the master said that she doesnt know whats going on. My ear was festering and that same day I went to the emergency room. There I was told that there was a terrible infection and I have to get really painful, emergency antibiotic shot I was also prescribed a course of antibiotics and I missed work because of all this.Terrible experience, 10 days of pain, antibiotics and doctors. And its still not done. Still trying to figure out with lymph nodes and pain leftovers.*UPD*I contact Mejuri as they asked me under this review just to be told that all possible infections, Hepatitis and I guess HIV I could get during the procedure its only my problem and basically they dont care.So be careful, if something going wrong with your piercing, only you gonna face it as well as you medical bills!",Los Angeles,0.0,2024-06-10,1,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,"

"I got my second hole re-pierced at this locations pop-up piercing shop and it was not a transparent experience whatsoever. I have waited over year for another pop-up so I can get my post changed out to a shorter one - as promised by Mejuri - yet still not delivered. While they seem like a quality store, their jewelry needs to be cleaned constantly to be nice and isnt worth the investment in my opinion because most are not real gold/silver - just plated. For pricing of their plated jewelry, you can easily get better truly non-tarnishing jewelry from other brands for a lot cheaper.

"I went to Mejuri for the first time after being a longtime fan, but I was sadly disappointed with my experience. Beyond the security guard, no other employee of the store greeted me. I cruised around the store for maybe a solid 25 minutes before someone even offered me assistance or to inform me of the try-on procedures in the store. Despite my interest in purchasing the diamond cluster ring, no one actually bothered to assist me despite me verbally expressing my desire to purchase the ring. Everyone continued to ignore me and to help other guests. It wasnt until about 5 minutes prior to my exit that one associate offered me assistance.It left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth for the brand. While my experience does not reflect the brand as a whole, it did tarnish my perception of it. Additionally, I hadnt shopped at Mejuri since before the pandemic. So, it was exciting to see the pieces I was interested in in-person for the first time. But upon my visit, I came to find that much of Mejuris designs have changed. The rings appear even thinner and more fragile and delicate than when I first started shopping from the band. Dimond, pearl, and gemstone accents are miniscule on the rings. They are significantly smaller than when I first started buying from the brand.I understand they may have altered the designs to keep the prices affordable during a time where gold is at an all-time high, but they seem to have compromised quality for price. However, Im not so sure how affordable Mejuri is to the average consumer anymore. Along with my interest in the ring, I was also interested in some diamond hoop earrings from the brand and while I was browsing online at other vendors, I found nearly the same hoop earrings available at almost half the price at Zales.Overall, it seems times have changed for Mejuri and Im not sure if I will continue to shop there. For others, I would recommend exploring other options before purchasing at Mejuri. You get what you pay for, but sometimes its better to make an investment in a longer lasting product.",Los Angeles,4.0,2023-02-10,1,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,"

Horrible in store experience! I have ordered Mejuris jewelry online and was so psyched to see that they have a brick and mortar shop in LA. But the two people working were so rude and arrogant! The security guard was nice but the two attendants were terrible! From the moment we walked in the woman was so rude to us and didnt say a word just put a bottle of hand sanitizer in my face. this place has solid jewelry but i wont buy again because they have such horrible customer service. have never experienced anything like this.,Los Angeles,3.0,2023-02-10,1,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,"

"Cute boutique with a friendly and helpful staff! Not your typical high-pressure-sales jewelry store experience, which I really appreciate. My only disappointment was that the pieces I went specifically to see (and buy) were out of stock at the Melrose location. When I asked about inventory, I got the feeling that the boutique doesnt carry much in-store (or perhaps I was just unlucky in my choices). Otherwise, an enjoyable shopping experience--it was great to see all of Mejuris stunning pieces in person and to try them on. Will definitely visit again the next time Im in LA.",Los Angeles,0.0,2021-02-10,5,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,"

"Im a huge fan of Mejuri and love that I can come here before making my final purchase decision. Though the website is great, you dont really know what the jewelry is going to look like on you until you try it on. Yknow what I mean?Everyone here is lovely, personable, kind, and helpful. They check in to make sure all your questions and needs are met, but they also dont hover and pressure you to buy something. Once you are ready to order, they will bring out an iPad and help you purchase it right then and there. Other than the showroom jewelry, they dont have jewelry in stock -- which means your order will arrive via mail. Just a heads up, in case you were hoping to get jewelry on the same day lol.Depending on how many people are already inside the store, you might have to wait a few min outside. It was a short wait for me, 10min at most.Parking can be tricky, as Melrose is always busy.

"Lizell was the sales associate that helped me during my first time visiting the store. I came at a very good time during the  middle of the week, as I did not feel rushed to try on the products. Given that it was during covid, I had to wait in line outside while 2 customers were allowed in store. I liked that the staff did not pressure me into buying anything, but instead assisted in me trying everything that caught my eye. I appreciated that, as I do not like to be persuaded in buying anything. Lizell was super helpful and nice during my visit.

"I waited 50 minutes in the cold weather in line today to pick up a pair of $400 earrings I already paid full price for. The store was extremely understaffed with only two women working the day the store opened after being closed for multiple days for Christmas. In response to another customers complaint posted on this thread about the wait time, the owner writes that Merjuri offers online shopping and in-store pickup— well, I was unaware that I would have to wait in a nearly hour-long line for IN-STORE PICKUP which should take 2 minutes. Its as if Merjuri purposely understaffs the store after the holidays to discourage customers from returning their jewelry or making exchanges. If you dont want to waste your time, I suggest shopping somewhere else where the company actually cares about its customers and customer service.",Los Angeles,1.0,2022-02-10,2,"8404 Melrose Ave, Los Angeles, CA",CA,"

"I had long awaited this review. I had been here last november and asked for a flat from a piercer that seemed very nervous, shaky, and didnt even let me get a flat in the end, I left with a helix, that was crooked and never healed.About a month or two ago I had gone back to the location addressing my concern due to the fact that my helix wasnt healing and to begin with its not even what I asked for from the beginning, Modey was my new piecer at Mejuri that day and took such an amazing job of me, she had instantly said yea this needs to be fixed let me see what I can do for you. She ended up being able to fix my piercing with what I ended up wanting, I was a little hesitant at first due to my last experience but then she had really reassured me of her work in the process. Anyways fast foward about a month or two, I am so happy with my piercing! Modey was by far one of the best piercers I have ever been to and I have at least 20 piercings by other people, my flat looks great! and it looks ontrack to get the post downsized soon and be done healing! thank you so much Modey! I owe you the world with my new piercing you gave me!",San Diego,0.0,2024-09-10,5,"4545 La Jolla Village Dr Suite C-12, San Diego, CA",CA,"

"I love the jewelry but all three piercings I got at Mejuri had to be taken out because they didnt heal properly due to improper piercings. My thirds were both crooked and my helix was pierced not in line with my anatomy so I ended up with it not healed even after two years. On top of that, the $275 piece I purchased for my helix that I was told was solid gold tarnished after a year and a half. I would make sure and go to an APP certified piercer for piercings instead, jewelry quality will be better too.",San Diego,0.0,2024-10-10,3,"4545 La Jolla Village Dr Suite C-12, San Diego, CA",CA,"

"This is hands down, the best place to get your ears pierced. I got my helix and conch pierced back in May and had a lovely experience. I love the flat back and all the piercing options they have that. Youre talking about real gold and real gemstones. No more boring studs that leave you wishing you had something more sparkly. Once they were healed and the swelling went down, I was able to go back in and switch out the posts to something shorter for free! You can also opt for the $30 gold flat back vs titanium. To top off my already great experience, I recently lost the backing to an earring when I was taking off my motorcycle helmet. They again, gave me the new post for free!

"Im not one to leave bad reviews, unless I continue experiencing issues at a store I frequent. To be clear, I love Mejuri jewelry and have been a customer since before they had physical stores in Seattle. The issue here seems to be within customer service. Whenever I walk into this store, I always feel like their last priority. They greet everyone else and people who come in after me, and it seems like they avoid asking if I need help. I dont understand it. I worked at Nordstrom in fine jewelry and watches for over 5 years and give a lot of grace because I know that things can get chaotic. Considering the size of this store and the demand for product, it makes sense why they are always busy. This time I tried to make eye contact with one of the associates and they looked at me and then looked away, and greeted another customer that came into the store. I had errands to run so I didnt have makeup on nor did I have a ton of jewelry on, which is not usual for me. I dont want to make extreme assumptions so Ill let management take it from here.

"The store is beautiful, and it is really nice to see all of the items that they have online in person.However, I didnt have the best experience with the setup towards ear piercing. First, I asked to be contacted when they had a piercer lined up (which the staff said they would do), and was never emailed. Then I signed up for an appointment online, and it was canceled because the piercers schedule wasnt updated online. When I finally got to my appointment, I was told I couldnt get my ears pierced because of a possible keloid scarring issue I may have had on one of my previous piercings although I was willing to take the risk. This was fair, but I feel like this could have been a part of the terms & conditions form I had to sign. Also, the piercer didnt want to do 4 piercings although the website allows up to four in one appointment. The whole thing ends with Mejuri sending me an email on aftercare for piercings that I never received.I feel like there were so many factors that resulted in a not-great in-person experience for me.",Seattle,8.0,2023-02-10,2,"2621 NE University Village St, Seattle, WA",WA,"

Awful customer service from manager Alex!Me and my finance were excited about this store coming to Bellevue square and we bought a diamond necklace for her stack. We purchased necklace in store and when we opened it at home it was tangle with several knots. I went back to the store to return the necklace a few days later. The manager Alex told me he did not believe the necklace was sold us like that and that essentially I was lying about how it was sold. He initially was not going to accept the return and was persistent that it was not sold to us like that (which it was). No apology from them selling me a diamond necklace with a knot in it.

"Went into Mejuri on west 4th with my husband today to return a gift he received on Christmas. We both agreed that this store exhibited some of the worst, snooty customer service we have ever experienced. No one acknowledged us as we entered the store and we couldnt distinguish who even worked there. We walked to what seemed like the check out desk and waited patiently. As we waited, the piercing negative energy in this place was unbearable. I cant really explain the feeling other than it felt like we didnt belong there and that we were a burden to be helped. Ive never wanted to leave a business so quickly. As I read other reviews it comforts me to know that this isnt just some figment of my imagination. This store I cant imagine will last long. The jewelry itself isnt even good quality. Ive seen so many resellers of this particular brand on FB Marketplace which only confirms for me that this make is the IKEA brand of jewelry.",Vancouver,1.0,2025-01-27,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"I had a very bad experience in this Mejuri at W 4th in Vancouver, and Im still dealing with it years later.Two years ago, I got my wedding band at this store. A simple white gold band, with a letter engraved on the inside. Since then, two main problems came from it, leading me to spending a lot more to remedy the issue. Save yourself some trouble and dont buy there. They dont care about customer satisfaction.1. When it was sold to me, I tried different sizes to choose the right one and the customer service rep told me that I could always get it readjusted if the size wasnt right when I got it. When I got it, the size wasnt right so I went back to get it readjusted and they said that was not possible because of the engraving (no one had told me that before). I explained that at the store and they didnt care at all. So, I had to take it to another jeweler and pay extra to get the size adjusted in a rush before my wedding day.2. A few months later, the gold started to yellow and it didnt look like white gold anymore. I took it to the store and they said they couldnt do anything. I then took it to another jeweler and they explained to me that it wasnt fully white gold, but rather white gold plating with yellow gold underneath. This was not said to me when this store sold me the ring. So I had to pay for this other jeweler to re-plate it into white gold.After a few months, the same thing happened again, the gold started to yellow. I had moved away by that point so I took it to another jeweler in my new city and they told me the same, saying that every few months I would have to pay to have it re-plated if I wanted the ring to remain white because the ring was not made from white gold or a gold that could sustain that white gold/silver color I was looking for (and that was sold to me at the store).I would not have bought it if this store was honest about the products it sells; I wanted a white gold ring, and Im stuck with the wrong color.It wasnt cheap either. Save yourself a lot of trouble and avoid Mejuri for your important jewelry needs.",Vancouver,3.0,2024-11-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

Negative Issue: Incorrect information provided at time of purchase, resulting in additional costs for resizing and repeated re-plating.

"I recently visited this jewelry shop to purchase a bracelet and earrings. I brought two pictures of the items I was interested in and asked the female staff member to assist me in viewing them in person—one picture was of a bracelet, and the other was of a pair of earrings. However, the earrings she showed me were obviously different from the picture I provided. To make matters worse, the earrings I was asking about are one of their supposed bestsellers, so its baffling that she couldnt recognize them. The bracelet she showed me was also incorrect.When I proceeded to pay for the bracelet, I noticed that the price was different from what I was originally told. This means all the information she provided me was inaccurate. To add insult to injury, when I asked her for assistance in wearing the bracelet, she didnt even look at me or acknowledge me properly. She simply said, ""Okay, Im gonna help you,"" in a dismissive tone, unlocked the bracelet, and handed it to me. I struggled to put it on, and despite standing right next to me, she made no effort to assist.Its hard not to believe that she did this on purpose. Her terrible attitude and lack of professionalism made me feel completely unwelcome in the store. And seriously, how can a staff member not know their best-selling items?This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience Ive ever had. I will never return to this shop, and I strongly advise others to take their business elsewhere. There are plenty of other jewelry shops that offer better service, accurate information, and an overall pleasant shopping experience. This store doesnt deserve a single penny of your hard-earned money.",Vancouver,0.0,2024-12-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"I ordered some earrings online for black Friday to replace my old hoops. The old hoops completely snapped and pierced through my left ear, causing bleeding. I had asked in stores if Mejuri can replace the broken ones, and they said no. I still decided that with one good hoop from the previous pair left, it was worthy to give the brand another shot during their black friday sale. I went in to pick up my new earrings in stores last weekend - I spoke with a male employee with glasses to ask for help. It is difficult to describe this, but his tone of voice and expressions were rude, as if that I should not have been talking to him, or bothering him. I was told that I cannot pick up my order, because you need to present your photo ID, which I had no idea about. I asked if it would be okay to show them the order receipt and pick-up notification email instead as that is a proof of purchase. They said a cold ""No"", walked a couple of steps away from me, and left me standing at the counter… I looked at them helplessly as they stared at me in judgement and did not provide further customer service or assistance… I was quite taken aback and shocked at this treatment, but did not want to cause a scene and complain.. Moments after, I went to them and asked if I can speak to another staff member, and someone else came out from the back and handled the pick up thereafter.I find the unhelpful attitude and unprofessional initial encounter to be completely unnecessary. I hope the store can properly train their staff to provide bare minimum adequate customer service.Ive been a customer for the brand for quite some time, and going in stores to be treated in a disrespectful manner was very disappointing.",Vancouver,0.0,2025-01-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

They allowed us to go in together. The studio was beautiful. The piercing area was private and also just as beautiful and very clean. The piercer was so friendly and nice.

"Edit:Mejuri reached back out to me to offer replacement of the defective cartilage hoop since it was still well within the warranty period.While I understand theyre not a luxury brand, their prices are by no means cheap, so Id expect better customer service from them. I purchased diamond hoops for my cartilage piercing a little over a year ago, which is still within their 2-year warranty period. The clasp on one of the cartilage hoops has been loose, falling off my ear a few times since Ive worn it. Understandably, I was concerned its only a matter of time before I lose it so I reached out to them for a replacement under their warranty which was rejected because apparently they expect me to remove my cartilage hoop everytime before I sleep and before each shower, which is impractical and not a common practice at all for jewelry meant for cartilage, helix, naval piercings. I have the exact same hoop on my other ear which has also been worn since I purchased it and has not fallen off, but they refuse to accept that this one may have been a bit loose from the start (a concern also raised by others in the reviews on the product, which I regret not paying heed to). Ive owned multiple different cartilage earrings over the past couple of decades and have never had this issue before. Please be mindful they dont offer repair for their jewelry which can be quite frustrating as a customer.",Vancouver,0.0,2024-11-10,3,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

None: The customer had a negative experience with a defective cartilage hoop from Mejuri, which they purchased a little over a year ago. Despite being within the 2-year warranty period, their request for a replacement was rejected due to the brand's expectation for the customer to remove the hoop before sleeping or showering. The customer also expressed frustration with the lack of repair options and the price of the product. However, the customer did have a positive experience with Mejuri reaching out to offer a replacement after their review."
"I just wanted to express how frustrated I am with Mejuri. My earrings clasp broke in my ear yesterday all of a sudden and Mejuri declined to change the piece as it was outside their 2 year warranty claim. The decision made is honestly outrageous and Im trying hard to understand how you qualify as a proper jeweller if youre unable to provide the below services:- Youre unable to REPAIR what you sell. This is literally in the description of a jeweller, it doesnt even have to be a luxury one as you claim you are.- Youre unable to buy gold which is the funniest thing. You cant even buy back the item that you already sold.- You refuse to renew the item.- Last of all, you dont even sell the earring in singles. The customer is required to buy the item again.I also want to mention that this clasp has been already broken twice and I had to change it in store. Its super flimsy and it really speaks for the quality of your so-called jewelery. Your gold pieces are obviously not cheap and one makes this purchase thinking it would be an heirloom piece, to be used for the years to come, at least I did. I was mistaken! You lost a returning customer forever.",Vancouver,3.0,2024-10-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"Agreed with another review that they didnt like the lack of pricing on the items. I hate having to ask for the price of each item, and it made me uncomfortable. The sales was not particularly welcoming either, when I told her I was looking for a gift with a specific price range (~$150 for a necklace or bracelet). I only came here as the recipient likes this brand, but for the quality and lack of design, I can get this elsewhere for cheaper and at better quality.",Vancouver,1.0,2024-08-10,3,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"I visited a store to buy a gift for my wife, but no one approached or even greeted me. Although they attended to customers who arrived after me, I wasnt spoken to at all, no matter how long I waited. Since I had already decided on the item I wanted to purchase, I approached a staff member myself after about 30 minutes and made the purchase.

"1 star because I love the jewelry however the customer service could use some feedback.Upon requesting to purchase a set of earrings, the employee informed me they only had the single earrings in stock. I asked if I could purchase 2 singles for the price of a set as they did not have sets available in store or online. I was informed that they could not do this and as a result I feel this is poor customer service. To build customer clientele it would have been in their best interest to honour the price of a set.Secondly after purchasing a set online I lost one of the earrings which seems to be a common trend in the reviews. I realize this is a method of sales (so customers will purchase singles) however why not make the butterfly backings of good quality? Or perhaps offer alternative backings as well that tend to hold better.Generally speaking I do not find the service great here. It seems as though the employees are too busy chatting amongst themselves.EDIT:contacted customer support in regards to a bday discount code I received via email and accidentally deleted. Customer service via text is disturbingly not genuine (felt as if I was speaking to a robot). Could not provide me with discount code nor assist in any manner. Lack of professionalism.

"I had an excellent experience getting my lobes pierced in February (second holes). The piercing healed quickly and although it was expensive (minimum $75/earring+$25 piercing fee), I thought the quality of the earrings made it worth it. They pierce with threadless flat back earrings that are long to account for swelling and offer a free downsize after ~2 months after healing. When I was ready to downsize, I was notified that due to stock issues they did not have the shorter backs and it would be 2 weeks until they got them in. It has now been a month and I have still not been contacted about when they will be arriving. Once healed, the long backs get caught in everything and actually reopen the hole which is quite painful and can increase risk of infection. I finally have given up and bought my own short backs from a different company.  I also didnt realize the upgrade to the short backs is titanium not gold, so the cost of the earrings is really only for the very small front part of the earring. Im sure they will keep piercing and keep experiencing stock shortages forcing people to purchase their own backs or the Mejuri gold ones ($70) instead of the free downsize. After all of this, I dont think the cost of the earrings is worth it and the customer service I received has been pretty bad.",Vancouver,4.0,2024-02-10,2,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

I emailed them, they never bothered to reply back. I went down to the store and they said ' oh you kept inside the box,  thats why it has turned black and we cant do anything. I hardly wore these pieces. The store manager was so rude and did not bother to even address the issue. I invested $250 for this jewellery, I personally regret buying.",Vancouver,0.0,2024-02-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"I am giving zero star to the customer service and the experience I had in the Vancouver store today. I had ordered 2 items online and went to pick them up at the store. After trying the ring I decided to exchange it with another ring. Waited 1 hr in the store for this simple exchange and after the sale person made several errors with the transactions, I asked to see the manager. Unfortunately, the manager was really rude and although she knew that the sale person had mistaken several times, she didnt even apologize. Now that I have checking my credit card, I see that I have been charged $430 for the two items that were supposed to be $140! I am just hoping that the multiple refunds she did are gonna show up. This was my first and my last time to buy anything from Mejuri.

"Used to be a long-time supporter of the brand but will never shop here ever again. Management will tell you lies just to scam you into going into the store again and not honour what they promised.Also warning - not only is packaging inconsistent, be sure to check that you have all your items. I ordered a 14k gold necklace and only the pendant came, not the necklace itself (website clearly shows it comes with both). Had to argue with customer service and almost break open every part of the packaging to prove to them they did not send me the item as advertised when it was clearly their mistake in the first place.

Sharing this review based so far on customer experience. Will adjust if they are able to address my concern. Paid for the express shipping - as stated in their website 1-2 business days. My expected ship date does not fall within the provided time (even excluding the date of purchase to fill the order need before shipping).Edit:Customer service has not responded to my inquiry about the shipping delay.

"Service was friendly and they were able to accomodate an exchange outside of the typical return period. However, I needed to decide where to ship a package. We were told the replacement item would not ship for over a week and used this information to decide where to ship the replacement item. However, the package shipped the next day instead. I tried contacting both the shipping company and Mejuri customer service to hold the package but unfortunately could not get through to the shipping company and Mejuri customer service was unhelpful in resolving this issue. Managers need to inform their workers of the correct shipping times to tell customers. Now nobody is at the location to claim the $200 parcel and there is nobody to help",Vancouver,2.0,2023-02-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"Cancelling online order is almost impossible.I ordered 2 instead of 1 diamond necklace by mistake. I realized that 5 minutes later and tried contacting them via the chat to cancel half of my order. I got connected finally and was told that they were unable to cancel because the order was already fulfilled, despite I had only ordered 5 mins prior. I had no choice but to request a free return, which was fine but I unfortunately lost connection and my chat was closed only after 5 minutes of not responding. I had to go through the whole process to get connected to the chat just to request a free return. Basically, their process makes it difficult to cancel any order by mistake and their customer service isnt the most helpful. I dont shop here a lot but I wont be returning as a customer.",Vancouver,0.0,2023-02-10,2,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"Bought a pair of 14K gold hoop earrings ($784 including tax)  online for my daughter and she was happy with it. No issue.I decided to place another order online for 2 bracelets and earrings that came to $656.32, but changed my mind and immediately tried to cancel. At first, they wouldnt let me cancel the order and I was told that they cannot cancel if its already being processed by their fulfillment team. I placed the order on Sept 28th and it wasnt shipping until Oct. 4th. I thought it was absurd that I couldnt cancel an order I placed on the same day. Worse, to be told they couldnt do anything about it. I said if they go ahead with the order that I would just contact my bank and dispute the charge. The sales rep replied back and said she was allowed to make an exception and that I was going to get a refund back within 5-10 business days.Long story short, yesterday was October 12th and I still have not received my refund after ten business days.  I contacted my bank and proceeded to dispute the charge.I canceled my order the same day I placed it and yet my card was still charged and no product was sent. THAT IS CALLED FRAUD!!!

"Worst experience Ive ever had purchasing online. I used their sizing guide for a ring and even had someone help me to make sure I was doing it right, still, the size ended up being completely wrong. I asked for resizing it or for a return and they refused because the ring is engraved. I was never properly warned of these terms during the purchase process.A waste of money... but the worst part is the feeling of being deceived and disrespected by their customer service people that say that they empathize with my problem but that want to be fair with all our customers as an excuse for not helping.",Vancouver,0.0,2024-02-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

I brought 4  Mejuri puzzles as Christmas presents and so far 1 of them was missing 5 pieces (no one else has completed the puzzle its super difficult) . I asked for a refund their policy is to replace their product. Now the onus is on me to ship the product back (I sent pictures). Always check a businesss return policy I wont shop here again.

Im happy with one of my piercings, but the other one is pierced lower than where she put the dot. It looks asymmetrical compared to the other side, and even next to the piercing beside it.

"I used to love buying from Mejuri online, and was very excited when this store opened so I could shop in person. As other reviews reflect, my experience when the store first opened was uncomfortable and chaotic. But! I thought Id give them another shot since theyve been open a year now.Same creepy and cold atmosphere. This is another cashless (so, classist) store. Want to know the price? A rep has to look it up on their website with an ipad. Want to buy? Take your credit card, enter allll the info in on their website manually (yes, were still at their physical store), and wait for someone to pack your order in the back. Why shop online when you can shop online while standing in the store? Staff have been cold both times Ive been here - Mejuris *empowement* and *accessible luxury* culture does not carry into the physical store.Spare your time, money, and good vibes and take your business to the other more longstanding jeweler on 4th.",Vancouver,8.0,2023-02-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

This review is not about this store, but rather Mejuris online store. If youre looking to purchase anything online from them, DO NOT. Its currently December 19th and I still have no idea where my item I purchased on November 22nd is. Its been almost a month and Ive missed my wedding anniversary. Ive reached out to Mejuri several times online but theve done little to nothing to resolve the issue. I even asked to have my order cancelled yesterday and be issued a refund which they said they cant do. When I originally purchased my order from their website, I did so with their shipping guidelines in mind, which clearly is not accurate. I strongly suggest looking elsewhere before buying anything online from Mejuri. I have the emails between myself and Mejuri that ill gladly share with anyone who needs more proof.",Vancouver,2.0,2023-02-10,1,"2166 W 4th Ave, Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

Workers were very nice but I came in to get two lobe piercing and they are not even close to symmetrical. Will probably lets once side close and re-pierced at another store. Totally unacceptable for the price you pay for two lobe piecing which is around $250.

"Would give 0 stars if I could.I had a terrible experience at Mejuri. The sales associates were not attentive and they were extremely unfriendly. When you dont display prices, its expected that staff will be more engaging and provide you with all the product details —but that was not the case. I asked for prices of a few items, and the associate kept giving me rough estimates with annoyed expressions, as though I was wasting her time.When I asked for the price of a ring, she told me its around 50 and when I asked if that was before or after the discount, she simply told me, there is no discount on that, without asking how much I was planning to spend. The promotion was that you had spend over $150 to get discount. I had already set aside other items and would have easily qualified for the discount, but they didnt bother to offer any information and just assumed that i wont be getting a discount lolThe only friendly person with a smile was a guy who assisted me briefly, but even he kept walking away and disappearing in the back even as I was paying, which felt very unprofessional. It was clear that they werent interested in providing any kind of real service.I came in with intentions to buy multiple pieces, but after the poor customer service, I decided to leave with just one item—one I already knew the exact price of because I looked online.Jewelry stores used to offer a luxury experience, but at Mejuri, the associates attitudes reflect the same lack of quality Ive experienced with their jewelry.I wont be returning.",West Vancouver,3.0,2024-12-10,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"The sales associate was not at all familiar with products and pricing and told me that there was nothing in my budget of up to $150. I asked for pricing on a bracelet I was interested in and was told that the gemstone was a real diamond and therefore not in my budget. Ive since looked up the bracelet online and see its a topaz gemstone and the bracelet goes for $98. I also see another bracelet for $118 that was right next to the topaz one in store, and yet he told me theres nothing in the store in my price range. Ive shopped at Majuri before and have certainly seen items within $150, but with his lack of help and smug comment to brush me off, he made me feel like I wasnt ""good enough"" to help since I clearly cant afford to shop there. What is now clear to me is his lack of any product knowledge and his immense unprofessionalism. If the products at Mejuri are priced as high as he says, then perhaps their sales associates should learn more about them and care for the customers purchasing these ""big ticket items"". It was a very disappointing experience.",West Vancouver,1.0,2025-01-10,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"I had a really awful experience here. I asked to try on a certain ring but was unsure of my size and was given one to try on. After she gave me the ring, she would walk away to stand at the wall. I would have to try and get her attention again for a different size. I eventually did not care anymore and was clearly not welcome here as this employee ignored me and would walk away repeatedly. The store was nowhere near busy but I could not seem to get sized to purchase the rings I was interested in. I specifically came because I received an email about a members sale I wanted to take advantage of, but ended up leaving empty handed and never to enter this store again. Worst customer service and sales I have ever seen.",West Vancouver,1.0,2024-12-10,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"Went there to do some xmas shopping and there were no prices listed, you have to scan a QR code which takes you to the whole website and not the individual item your looking at - so i was hoping someone could help me but all of the store associates were busy at that moment, so i waited and looked at other items - while that was happening i noticed other customers were getting greeted and asked if they needed help, where I wasnt at all from the moment i stepped in the door - it was actually frustrating and disappointing to see that indigenous customers are still treated this way - so while they were literally standing around ignoring me, i let them know ive been waiting for someone to become available or notice i needed help (since i was standing there for at least a couple minutes scrolling for the item i was looking for) but they didnt and thanked them for the lack of help and customer service - the sales associate literally glared at us and said nothing, absolutely nothing - this store is terrible and has terrible customer service - i left feeling frustrated",West Vancouver,0.0,2025-01-10,1,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"Came to this location to purchase two 14k rings I had looked at online - the sales person was very helpful to find sizing and styling suggestions for stacking rings. They were sold out of one option I had wanted but online you can check stock so I will keep checking that. Prices are fair and jewelry is pretty. Good options between gold vermeil (plated) and solid gold. IMO it is worth the extra price for the solid gold, and their solid pieces are not too much more than the plated. Will return in future for more purchases :) My boyfriend also commented on their more masculine pieces, titanium bands etc., we will be back for sure :)",West Vancouver,0.0,2024-04-10,5,"925 Main St Unit H3, West Vancouver, BC, Canada",BC,"

"1st time I went to the store had to leave because they dont take cash. That was fine service was good and girl super attentive I let her know that I had a voucher and she didnt hesitate to apply to my order immediately. Second time I took my card to buy the same items and the girl was quite unpleasant. Lots of knowledge about the product but quite an attitude that felt uncomfortable. Told her about my voucher and she couldnt care less. Had to remind her about that after she typed my total on the card machine and she rushed me to get the code. Ended giving up looking for the voucher, just wanted to leave the store as quickly as possible. She wanted to make that sale so badly that forgot that an actual human was paying for the merchandise.

"Went in to pick up my an online order that I have already paid for. It took a while for them to take it out. As per the website, the jewelry bought will be beautiful wrapped, as I mentioned online, that it was a gift. It just came in the boxes and the linen bag (might be this stores definition of beautifully wrapped)Anyway, hungout for a while to see if I can purchase something more for myself. None of the staff were accommodating as the displays had no price tags. All the sales representatives were busy chatting or on the iPad looking at something. I was trying to get eye contact, but no one seemed interested to sell me anything. I just left the store very disappointed.
